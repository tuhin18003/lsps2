  content : "It is with great sorrow that we provide this notice to inform patients of our aesthetician Sharon’s passing. Over the past couple of months Sharon has been battling cancer, and was not able to overcome it despite all efforts. She passed from the comfort of her son’s home, and with the presence of her family.
        <br><br>
        Sharon’s life’s work was helping people, whether it be patients, friends, or family in any way she could. Not only a talented medical aesthetic provider, but a confidant to anyone that came to know her. Her passion was her patients, and the pure happiness of helping her patients achieve their aesthetic goals brought joy to her life. 
        <br><br>
        She will not only be missed as a provider to The Michael Horn Center, but as a friend to all of us here. 
        I invite you to contact me directly with any questions or concerns you may have, and know that my guidance would have been supported by Sharon wholeheartedly.
        <br><br>
        At this time her family has postponed funeral services, and has elected for a Celebration of Life, date to be set in the weeks to come. If you are interested in receiving information surrounding this, please email me directly at jessica@michaelhorncenter.com. 
        <br><br>
        Do not despair, for her memory lives on through us. <br>
        Sincerely,<br>
