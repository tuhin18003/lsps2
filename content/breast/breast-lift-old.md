shortDescription : "Mastopexy, or breast lift, is commonly performed to improve the appearance and shape of drooping or sagging breasts in women who have experienced loss of volume in their breast tissue due to pregnancy, weight loss, or aging. Dr. Horn can remove excess skin, once the skin is removed he'll reposition the nipple and recontour the breast, creating a more lifted, youthful, and shapely figure. Typically performed as an outpatient procedure using general anesthesia, mastopexy can cause temporary swelling, numbness, and bruising. Most patients are able to return to daily activities in about one week. At our Chicago, Illinois center, breast lift may be performed alone or in conjunction with breast enlargement surgery based on your individual goals and needs. Dr. Horn can help each patient determine what choice is best for her."

#### What are the Risks of Breast Lift Surgery?

There is the possibility of complications with any surgical procedure and the breast lift is no exception to that rule.  Risks include adverse reaction to anesthesia, bleeding, and infection. There may be variance with the symmetry of the breasts or the height of the nipples. In very rare occurrences the nipples and/or surrounding breast lose sensation. These risks can be greatly reduced by closely following your doctor’s instructions for preparation before the surgery and recovery afterward.

#### How Should I Prepare for Breast Lift Surgery?
If you are a smoker, you will be asked to stop at least two weeks prior to surgery and for a period afterward. Smoking can hinder your body’s ability to heal and cause serious complications during and after the procedure. If there is a history of breast cancer in your family, or if you are old enough to be at risk for the condition, you may require a pre-surgical mammogram. You will be asked about the medications you take including vitamins and supplements. After answering any questions you have, the doctor will make sure that you have somebody to drive you home and to assist you during the first few days of healing.

#### What do I Need to do After Breast Lift Surgery?

You should get out of bed periodically after the surgery is completed. While you will be able to move with less discomfort after a few days, you will be restricted from bending, lifting, and straining your body. You will be advised to sleep on your back for a period of time after the surgery. For a few weeks, you will need to wear a support bra or sports bra to keep your breasts confined. There may be temporary numbness or sensation problems in the breasts and nipples. Incisions start out red or pink but fade over the next few months.

#### How Long does Recovery Take?
You can get back to work after a week or so and after a month you will be able to take on normal daily activities. Your doctor may ask you to refrain from sexual intercourse for at least two weeks during the initial healing process. Any activity that involves moving your breasts must be gentle and slow while the tissue heals.

#### Will the Results be Long Lasting?
The results should last indefinitely, but may be affected by extreme weight gain or pregnancy. Gravity will still affect your breasts a bit over time, but only weight fluctuation will cause major changes in the breast appearance following the procedure.
