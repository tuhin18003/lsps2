highlightedText : "Reduction mammoplasty is a surgical procedure designed to reduce overly large breasts to a more comfortable size and contour. Such surgery is indicated when unusually large breasts cause pain in the shoulders, back, and lower back. Other undesirable side effects in oversized breasts involve improper posture and bra straps cutting into the shoulders. Overly large breasts often interfere with normal physical activity. Typically, the desired result is smaller, better shaped breasts that are proportioned with the rest of your body."

shortDescription : "The most common surgical method of performing a reduction mammoplasty uses a three-part incision. One incision is made around the areola. Another runs vertically from the bottom edge of the areola to the crease underneath the breast. The third is a horizontal incision beneath the breast which follows the natural curve of the breast crease. In some situations, the horizontal incision is omitted. After the excess breast tissue, fat, and excess skin are removed, the nipple and areola are shifted or transposed to a higher position while preserving their blood supply.

After surgery, your breasts will be wrapped in a gauze dressing and supported by a surgical bra. Loss of breast or nipple sensation is possible, but, usually is not permanent. You should avoid strenuous exercise for a few weeks. You should be able to return to work within two weeks."

<h1 style="font-size:30px;">Breast Reduction Surgery Chicago - Here's What You Should Know</h1>
Are you in the process of deciding whether or not a breast reduction is right for you? Many males with gynecomastia (abnormal enlargement of the breast tissue) choose to undergo this procedure, but for women it may be more difficult to make the decision to reduce the size of their breasts. Breast reduction isn’t the same as reducing the size of implants; it is reducing the size of one’s natural breasts for a variety of reasons.

#### Who is a Good Candidate for Breast Reduction?

![Large Breast Reduction Surgery Chicago](../../images/procedure/breast/breast-reduction.jpg "Breast Surgeon Dr. Michael Horn")

The reasons why you may want to consider having Breast Reduction Surgery performed include:

* Self-consciousness about breast size
* Irritated skin under breasts
* Back or neck pain due to breast weight
* Having heavy breasts with downward pointing nipples
* Having large pendulous breasts
* Breast tissue that is too big for body size
* Difficulty engaging in physical activity due to breast size

These are all good reasons to have breast reduction surgery. If your breasts are getting in your way in your day-to-day life or are causing you pain, there may be a major imbalance between your breast size and your body size.

During your consultation with your doctor you can discuss your reasons for considering Breast Reduction Surgery along with your goal for the breasts you would like to have after the procedure.

#### Insurance Coverage for Breast Reduction

Insurance will typically not pay for procedures that are deemed to be “cosmetic” in nature, but they will usually help pay for procedures deemed medically necessary. During your consultation, your doctor will discuss your insurance options with you to determine what your insurance will or will not cover and will also provide documentation outlining your need for the procedure and what the expected prognosis would be without it. Providing a letter of predetermination to your insurance company will give you an idea of what will be covered under your policy.

#### Risk Factors for Breast Reduction Plastic Surgery

Breast reduction surgery carries many of the same risks as other surgical procedures. You may have infection, bleeding, or an adverse reaction to anesthesia. There is a possibility of swelling and bruising. You may have some variance in the symmetry of the breasts after the procedure, or you may experience a temporary loss of sensation around the nipple. Your doctor will provide a thorough and detailed explanation of all risk factors associated with Breast Reduction Surgery during your consultation. Be sure to discuss any concerns you have and provide your doctor with all details of your medical history to ensure the best possible outcome after the procedure.

#### Prior to Breast Reduction Surgery

**At our Chicago, Illinois center, we understand that breast reduction surgery is a personal decision and that individual goals vary.**

There are several steps you can take prior to surgery to reduce risk factors and ensure a positive outcome. If you are a smoker, you will be required to stop at least two weeks before the procedure. This is extremely important as smoking can cause serious complications during the procedure as well as during the initial healing phase.
You will be asked to provide your doctor with a list of all prescription and over-the-counter medications you take as well as any vitamins or supplements to ensure there will be no adverse reactions. Your doctor may ask that you avoid taking blood-thinning medications such as aspirin prior to surgery. You will also need to arrange to have somebody drive you home after the procedure and to help you with your daily needs for the first few days of recovery.

#### Breast Reduction Surgery Recovery

In the days following your procedure, you should not be bending, lifting or doing strenuous work. Sleep on your back and make sure to wear a support bra or sports bra for added breast support. Bruising and swelling will take a couple of weeks to go down and you will want to keep well-rested. You may be back at work in a couple of weeks, depending on the physical requirements of your occupation. Do not engage in strenuous exercise for about a month after surgery and avoid sexual activity for at least two weeks.

Your doctor will provide you with a detailed explanation of everything you can expect after your surgery along with what activities to avoid and when you can expect to get back to your normal daily routine.
