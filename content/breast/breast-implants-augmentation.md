<br>
<img class="img-fluid w-25 float-left" src="../../images/breast/vectra3.jpg" alt="Breast augmentation surgery" >

Breast implant / augmentation performed by Dr. Michael Horn is designed to enhance natural breast cup size and shape to fulfill the patient’s personal wishes of improvement. With [saline or silicone gel implants ](/breast/saline-silicone-breast-implants/), you now have an opportunity to make the cosmetic changes you’ve always dreamed of.

With 20 years experience and thousands of satisfied breast implant patients, Dr. Horn provides an exceptional level of talent and confidence to help you achieve the beauty, refinement and self-assurance you desire.

For decades, breast implant / augmentation, or augmentation mammoplasty, has offered a surgical alternative to women who are unhappy with their natural breast shape and size. Breast augmentation is an ideal solution for achieving a larger and fuller breast size as well as restoring symmetry to breasts with a dissimilar appearance and providing a more appealing contour. Women often experience an undesirable change in their breast size and shape after weight loss, pregnancy or breast feeding, and breast augmentation can bring back a more full-and-natural look while doing wonders for their confidence and self-esteem. Our patients typically claim that breast implants have brought a vital balance to their figure, which allows them to dress and take part in activities they didn’t have the confidence for prior to surgery. For these reasons, breast implant / augmentation is often considered to have a positive impact on a woman’s overall lifestyle and well-being.

Breast implant surgeon in Chicago, Dr. Michael Horn has been known to produce wonderful results, but it is important to know that this procedure is not intended to correct sagging or drooping breasts. For women who wish to correct this issue, a breast lift, or a mastopexy, may be required. If you are a candidate for both a breast lift and a breast implant / augmentation, Dr. Horn can perform both procedures at the same time, which is known as an augmentation mastopexy. You will be able to discuss your goals and how Dr. Horn can help you during a personal breast augmentation procedure consultation visit.

If you are in the Chicago area and are interested in receiving a personal breast implant augmentation – breast implant consultation with Dr. Horn, <a href="tel:13122029000">please call</a> to [schedule your appointment](/contact) at the offices of the Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic Surgery located in downtown Chicago.

#### Placement of Breast Implants

There are two ways that an implant can be placed into your breast. During augmentation, Dr. Horn will either place your implant underneath the chest muscle (pectoralis) or right behind your breast tissue. How you choose to have your implant placed will be determined by your preferences and body type. Although Dr. Horn has performed surgeries using both placements, he may recommend placement behind the chest muscle, as this has been shown to help reduce the risk of capsular contracture (a breast augmentation complication), and can offer a more natural appearance. Breast implant placement is considered safe, and does not interfere with mammogram breast cancer detection results.

#### My Breasts are Saggy, is Breast Augmentation Right for Me?

![top rated breast implant surgeon](../../images/breast/saggingbreasts.jpg "chicago breast plastic surgeon Dr. Michael Horn MD")

If you have saggy breasts, Dr. Horn can perform a procedure to correct them, called a mastopexy. A breast implant alone may not correct saggy breasts, and if this is your goal, Dr. Horn will most likely recommend a mastopexy for your needs. If you would like to receive a breast augmentation and correct saggy breasts, a combination of both procedures, called an augmentation mastopexy, can be performed at the same time.

#### What are the Risks of Breast Augmentation?

As with any surgery, breast augmentation is a surgical procedure that poses a small degree of risk to the patient. Before making your decision, it’s important to consider the benefits of receiving an augmentation as well as the risks of possible complications associated with the procedure.

#### Are Breast Implants Safe?


![Breast Implant Questions](../../images/breast/natrella2.jpg "Q&A Breast Implants in Chicago")


As a highly-valued medical device, breast implants have undergone rigorous studies and modifications for decades to ensure their safety and reliability. Natrelle® Inspira silicone-filled implants used at The Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic Surgery have been the subject of extensive clinical studies for structural integrity and material safety in the US as well as within European research groups. Years of research by independent science groups that include the Institute of Medicine have found no connection between breast implants and autoimmune disease or other systemic diseases.

Because undergoing breast augmentation is a big life decision, there are many important factors you should consider before moving forward. Although they are designed to last for years, breast implants are not guaranteed to last a lifetime. You may eventually require surgery to replace your implants in the future. The appearance of your breast implants may change over a period of time and can be influenced by factors such as weight loss, pregnancy and menopause. To ensure the health of your breasts and implant quality, it is recommended to receive regular examinations after augmentation surgery.

Augmentation also comes with the responsibility of being aware of your breast implants and doing your best to ensure their safety. Although implants are generally considered safe and durable, they may leak or rupture due to trauma, an error during surgery, or as a result of a mammogram. If you choose to receive a mammogram anytime after your breast implant surgery, it’s very important to advise your doctor and mammogram technician that you have breast implants so they can conduct the procedure without causing damage to your implants.

In the case of a rupture, your implants will need to be removed through surgery. A rupture can usually be noticed by visual observation or detected with an MRI. In most cases of breast augmentation, a condition known as Capsular contracture occurs slowly after the procedure. This is your body’s natural response to a foreign object, and happens when internal scar tissue begins to tighten around the implant. When this occurs, the breast implant may begin to sit higher on the chest or appear tighter than before. It may also feel harder or look different than when it was first placed into your breast. If the issue reaches the point of distorted appearance or is causing sensitivity or pain, your breast implants may require removal or a revision surgery.

#### How to Prepare for Your Breast Augmentation Surgery

If you’ve decided that breast augmentation is right for you, you may begin preparing for your surgery by following the preparation guidelines provided by Dr. Horn and his staff, who will be there to assist you through each and every step to ensure that you are prepared for a safe and rewarding surgery.

If you are over the age of 50 or have a pre-existing medical condition, you will need to receive medical clearance for breast augmentation from your primary care provider. To ensure your safety, your patient coordinator will guide you through the process of receiving any necessary laboratory tests required for medical evaluation. You may be advised to adjust any current medication you are taking to accommodate breast augmentation recovery, which you will discuss with Dr. Horn and your patient coordinator in detail. It will be necessary to avoid aspirin, blood-thinning medications, herbal teas and supplements for 2 weeks prior to surgery. It will be necessary to completely avoid cigarettes and all other nicotine-containing agents for a minimum of 2 weeks before surgery, and for 1 month after surgery to ensure a healthy recovery of the breast tissue.

If you have any questions that you forgot to ask Dr. Horn during consultation, please address them as soon as possible before surgery. During your scheduling process and preparation, you will receive an email recap of all of your information, which will include the details of your consultation with Dr. Horn, and the dates and times of your surgery.

#### What Should I Expect During My Breast Augmentation Recovery?

#### Postoperative Appointments

After surgery, you will have several postoperative appointments to ensure that you are recovering normally and that your breast augmentation has achieved the desired results. Your first appointment will be the next day after surgery, during which the incisions will be examined and you will be provided with all the information you need for the recovery process. You will have another postoperative appointment after 6 weeks, during which your progress will be reviewed, any concerns you have can be discussed, and creams and ointments recommended for your breast tissue and incision areas. During this appointment, you will also take photographs of your new breasts to compare the results with preoperative photos.

Please consider that your breasts will still be healing and adapting to the implants 6 weeks after surgery. Improvements in shape, comfort and appearance should be expected during and after this period of time. You will see Dr. Horn again 6 months and 1 year post-surgery to monitor your progress and make comparisons of your results. To ensure that everything has gone well after your surgery, please feel free to stay in touch with Dr. Horn and his staff anytime during and after the recovery process.

#### When Can I Expect to See the Final Result?

You will be able to notice the benefits of breast augmentation immediately after surgery, however, it usually takes about 2 months before your breasts become fully-adapted to the implants and have the ideal shape that you’re looking for.

While some patients achieve their final results faster than others, giving your breasts the proper time to take form and adapt to the implants always produces the expected results
