#### October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month

In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, our breast surgeon in Chicago is dedicated to raising awareness about this disease. Did you know that one in eight women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime? While there are over 3.3 million breast cancer survivors alive and well in the U.S. today, it is important to shed light on those who are still suffering. If women are diagnosed with breast cancer or even the BRCA gene, they may opt to get a mastectomy to remove cancerous or potentially cancerous breast tissue. If you’re interested in getting breast implants after a mastectomy, Dr. Horn can help restore your confidence.
