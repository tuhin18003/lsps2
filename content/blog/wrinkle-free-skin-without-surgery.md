#### Introducing BBL Photorejuvenation

Aesthetic treatments are evolving all the time thanks to advances and innovations in technology and research. BBL photorejuvenation is a cutting-edge, non-invasive, anti-aging treatment, which tightens the skin, dramatically reducing the visibility of facial lines, wrinkles, and folds. The Sciton BBL (BroadBand Light) is officially the most powerful IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) device currently available, and it produces staggering results. 

There are myriad factors that can influence the speed and severity of skin aging, and [BBL BBL laser treatment](/medspa/bbl-laser) is designed to rejuvenate and revive the skin without the need for surgery. As you get older, exposure to UV rays and other environmental conditions, lifestyle factors, and the natural process of aging can all take their toll on your skin. As your body’s stores of collagen and elastin become depleted, the skin loses its youthful bounce and firmness, and this causes lines and wrinkles to develop. While some people are happy to embrace facial lines, others become self-conscious and dream of a more youthful, vibrant complexion. If you’re keen to keep the signs of aging at bay, or you wish to turn back the hands of time, BBl therapy is an excellent option.

#### How does Sciton BBL treatment work?

Sciton BBL is commonly referred to as photorejuvenation or a photo facial. This non-surgical procedure removes wrinkles using the latest in BroadBand Light technology. BBL boasts advanced dual-lamp technology, which provides IPL. The device targets the surface layers of the skin to promote collagen production, improving skin tone and firmness. Research conducted by a team based at Stanford University found that IPL alters the structure of the genes linked to skin aging at a molecular level to create fresher, younger-looking skin. 

Sciton BBL is an incredibly advanced [skin tightening treatment in Chicago](/medspa/bbl-laser), which utilizes precision techniques and customizable smart filters and cooling systems to treat a range of conditions and achieve optimum results for every client. Sciton BBL is used to target lines and wrinkles on the face most commonly, but it is suitable for almost all body parts.

#### What does treatment entail?

Before you start treatment, we’ll invite you to a consultation to discuss the ins and outs of the procedure and assess your skin. We’ll talk about what happens when you have treatment, the benefits of this brilliant anti-aging therapy and what you can expect, and we’ll be able to answer any questions you have. We’ll make plans for your treatment and recommend a number of sessions based on your individual needs. Sciton BBL photo facials last around 15-30 minutes, and you should notice a positive difference after the first session. We will recommend a number of appointments based on the condition and appearance of your skin and the results you expect to achieve. In most cases, 3-6 sessions will be sufficient to produce incredible results. Sessions take place every 2-4 weeks. 

When you come in for treatment, you will be asked to lie back and relax, and the laser device will be aimed at your skin for a period of 15-30 minutes. The treatment isn’t painful, but you will feel a different sensation on your skin during the session. Many people have said that it feels like having a rubber band snapped on the skin very gently. We can apply numbing cream to the skin beforehand if you’re worried about discomfort.

#### What happens after treatment?

Once you’ve had your first treatment session, you’ll notice that your skin might look slightly darker and it may also be a little bit red. These effects are mild and temporary, and most clients resume normal day to day activities the day after treatment. As time passes, and you undergo more sessions, you’ll see brighter, smoother, line-free skin when you look in the mirror, and any residual redness should subside. We may recommend applying a light topical lotion to the skin after treatment depending on the individual. You can apply makeup straight after treatment, and we urge all our patients to use sunscreen to protect the skin from UV damage. 

Do you tend to zone in on furrows on your forehead or lines around your eyes or nose when you look in the mirror or flick through photos on your camera roll? If so, we have an amazing solution. With BBL laser treatment, we can remove wrinkles and roll back the years without the need for surgery.
