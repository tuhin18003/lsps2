#### Quick Reference Guide for Liposuction: Learn How It Can Take Years off Your Looks

Liposuction is one of the most popular cosmetic surgeries for both women and men. The procedure removes excess fat and contours the body, which can help you feel healthier and more confident.

Liposuction is a major surgery that requires careful consideration. If you’re thinking about getting liposuction, you can meet with the Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic surgery to discuss your goals and expectations. Before deciding to undergo liposuction, you should understand how the procedure works, what to expect during recovery, and what the possible side effects are.

#### How does liposuction work?

Liposuction is a procedure that removes fat cells from targeted areas of the body. During the procedure, the surgeon makes small incisions to access the targeted locations. Then, they insert a thin, hollow tube through the incisions and move it in a back-and-forth motion to break up the fat cells. Once the cells have been loosened up, the doctor uses a surgical vacuum or syringe to suction the cells out of the body.

The main purpose of liposuction is to enhance the body’s contour. Some of the most popular areas of the body for liposuction include the following:

* Abdomen and waist
* Thighs
* Buttocks
* Neck and chin
* Upper arms

It’s important to remember that liposuction is not a weight loss surgery. At most, liposuction will only remove a few pounds of fat. Liposuction is usually recommended for people who are at or near their target weight and want to remove the stubborn pockets of fat that won’t disappear with diet and exercise.

#### What are the benefits of liposuction?

Liposuction has a wide variety of health and cosmetic benefits. Here are some of the most common reasons people choose to have the surgery:

#### Liposuction is effective for contouring the body

While dieting and exercising are the best ways to lose weight, it’s impossible to spot-reduce fat just by working out or eating better. You’ll lose fat evenly across your whole body when you diet, but you may be left with extra pockets of fat in certain areas of your body. Liposuction removes fat cells from targeted areas, so it can have a big impact on your figure.

#### Liposuction can encourage healthier lifestyle habits

Liposuction permanently removes fat from the body, but some fat cells will remain. If you overeat or avoid exercising, you may gain weight, and the remaining fat cells will expand. It takes work to maintain the results of liposuction, but seeing your new and improved figure can motivate you to stick to healthy habits.

#### The results of liposuction are immediate

Swelling can take a few days or weeks to subside, but your full results should be visible shortly after your surgery. Seeing this immediate change in your body can greatly increase your self-confidence and can help you feel motivated to continue improving your body and health.

#### Liposuction can help with excessive sweating

Liposuction doesn’t just have cosmetic purposes. When the surgery is performed in the armpits and thighs, it can be a great way to reduce excessive sweating. Your surgeon can target the sweat glands and reduce your body’s ability to perspirate.

#### Liposuction can remove lipomas

Lipomas are fatty tumors that grow in soft tissue, often in the thighs, arms, and upper body. They’re usually harmless, but they can be uncomfortable and bothersome. Liposuction is one of the most common procedures used to remove lipomas.

#### Liposuction can treat lipodystrophy syndrome

Lipodystrophy syndrome causes an uneven or abnormal distribution of fat throughout the body. In some cases, this only affects one area of the body, and in others, it impacts the entire body. Lipodystrophy can sometimes lead to metabolic and hormonal issues, which can result in health complications. Liposuction can remove excess fat from certain areas of the body, preventing these health issues from developing.

#### What are the potential side effects of liposuction?

Liposuction is a very safe procedure, but all surgeries have their risks and possible side effects. Liposuction is done under anesthesia, so there can be complications during the surgery. It’s also possible for damage to occur to the nerves, blood vessels, lungs, or organs during surgery, but this is very rare.

The following are some of the most common liposuction side effects that occur during recovery:

* Swelling or bruising
* Numbness or changes in skin sensation
* Scarring
* Bumpy, dimpled, or wavy skin
* Change in skin color near surgical site

Most people recover from liposuction without any problems. Side effects that occur during recovery from the surgery usually go away within a few days or weeks. In rare cases, there can be permanent changes to your skin sensation. You should discuss the possible liposuction side effects with your doctor before undergoing the surgery, so you can weigh the risks and benefits.

#### What should I expect during and after the procedure?

Your surgeon will give you detailed instructions for preparing for the procedure. You will be advised to stop smoking a few weeks before the surgery to reduce the risk of complications. You may have to start or stop taking certain medications in the days leading up to your surgery.

Liposuction is usually done under general anesthesia, but it can sometimes be done with just local anesthesia. If you have local anesthesia, your surgeon will probably also give you a sedative to help you stay relaxed during the procedure.

Before your surgery, you should arrange for someone to drive you home and stay with you for a few days.

While you recover, you’ll have a compression garment or bandages over your treatment areas, which will help with swelling. Your surgeon may place small drains in your incisions to remove fluid, and you’ll be instructed on how to care for the incisions and drains.

You’ll probably need to wait a few days before returning to work. Your doctor will instruct you to wait several weeks before resuming exercise or other strenuous activities. You may be given painkillers and antibiotics to make your recovery more comfortable and reduce your risk of infection.

Once the swelling goes down, you’ll be able to see your liposuction results. If you maintain a healthy lifestyle, the results of liposuction can last for years.

If you have any questions or concerns about the procedure, you can discuss them with a consultation at the Michael Horn Center for cosmetic surgery. Choosing to undergo liposuction can be a big decision, but there are many physical and mental benefits to the procedure. Liposuction can help you look and feel better, and most patients agree that the benefits are worth undergoing the surgery.
