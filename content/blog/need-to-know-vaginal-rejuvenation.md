#### What exactly is vaginal rejuvenation treatment?

Vaginal rejuvenation treatment is a procedure, which is designed to subtly transform the external and internal tissue of the vagina to promote youthfulness, eliminate signs of aging and increase self-confidence. A non-invasive treatment, which can offer a host of benefits to women, this is a procedure that is gathering pace. Every year in the US, more and more patients are excited to find out more about vaginal rejuvenation and the benefits it offers.

#### Why would I consider vaginal rejuvenation?

There are several factors that can impact the vaginal tissue. Most notably, childbirth and aging affect the shape, firmness, and flexibility of the vagina. While many women accept the changes as part and parcel of having children and getting older, vaginal rejuvenation provides a solution for those keen to reap the rewards of a non-invasive, painless cosmetic procedure. As you get older, or your body goes through changes related to giving birth, you may experience unpleasant symptoms or become less confident about the appearance or suppleness of your vagina. This is a natural response, and it is a feeling shared by many women. 

It’s very common for women to experience symptoms such as dryness, irritation, and incontinence, especially after giving birth. Having children is a major ordeal for the body, and there are bound to be effects. While you might find that you bounce back very quickly and you’re happy with your body, there are many women who struggle to adapt to their new body after giving birth. If you suffer from incontinence, you’re conscious about the effects of aging or childbirth, or you’d like to feel more confident and relaxed in intimate scenarios, the CO2Re Intima vaginal rejuvenation procedure could be an ideal option for you.

#### What are the benefits of vaginal rejuvenation?

CO2Re Intima has an incredibly high success rate, with a patient satisfaction rating of 98%. This increasingly popular non-surgical solution offers women an array of benefits, including:

* Eliminating and reducing the severity of signs of aging and childbirth: the natural aging process can affect the shape and tone of the vaginal tissue, and women who have given birth are also prone to significant changes. Vaginal rejuvenation is designed to restore the natural shape and structure of the vaginal tissue, drastically reducing and even eliminating the signs of aging and birth. 
* Enhanced flexibility and improved shape and tone: the tone, shape, and suppleness of the internal and external vaginal tissue can be affected by getting older and giving birth to children. The form and flexibility of the tissue can be improved dramatically by non-surgical vaginal rejuvenation treatment, as the procedure tightens the skin and muscle tissue. 

* Relief for itchiness, irritation and dryness: it’s relatively common for women to experience vaginal dryness, itching, and irritation as they get older. Non-invasive vaginal rejuvenation restores healthy vaginal tissue, reducing the risk of unpleasant symptoms that many women find embarrassing and inconvenient.

* Treating pigmentation and dyschromia: as you get older, and your body goes through monumental changes, you may find that your vaginal tissue becomes discolored, or you suffer from skin pigmentation. Non-surgical vaginal rejuvenation can help to treat pigmentation and dyschromia, improving your confidence. 

* Improving incontinence: did you know that it is estimated that up to 20 million American women suffer from incontinence? Incontinence is particularly common among older women and women who have given birth, especially those who have a large number of children. Incontinence can affect your self-esteem, and it can also make even the most mundane day to day activities difficult to plan and execute. You don’t want to organize your schedule based on being able to dash to the nearest bathroom or hold back on making plans because you’re embarrassed or ashamed about incontinence. Non-invasive vaginal rejuvenation is a simple, painless solution, which could have a radical impact on your quality of life, as well as your self-confidence.

#### What does the procedure involve?

Vaginal rejuvenation treatment provided by an [expert Chicago plastic surgeon](/about) involves a very simple, quick, and painless procedure. Typically, treatment can be completed within just 15 minutes. This treatment uses cutting-edge CO2 laser technology to target multiple layers of vaginal tissue. Laser treatment is safe, it facilitates swift healing, and it eliminates the risk of pain. The lasers will treat several locations at the same time, using precision techniques to revitalize the external and internal tissue. CO2 laser treatment has been proven to improve tone, shape and flexibility, and to promote youthfulness by encouraging collagen production and the growth of elastic fibers. 

We recommend a series of three treatment sessions for optimum results. Treatments take place four weeks apart. The full effects of the procedure won’t become visible until after the final session, but the vast majority of patients notice a positive difference after the first treatment. 

After treatment, it’s possible to get back to your day to day life straight away. However, we do recommend abstaining from sexual activity for a week.
