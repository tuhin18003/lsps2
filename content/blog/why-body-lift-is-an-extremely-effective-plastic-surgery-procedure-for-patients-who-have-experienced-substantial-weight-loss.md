#### Why Body Lift is an Extremely Effective Plastic Surgery Procedure for Patients Who Have Experienced Substantial Weight Loss

#### Deciding to Make Changes in Weight
A decision to lose weight often reflects a health concern, and you deserve credit for choosing to do it. Anyone who has lost weight knows that it requires effort, sacrifice and sometimes even pain.

#### Understanding the Body Lift Concept
Your weight loss may have left sagging skin that obscures the underlying shape of your body. Skin can lose its elasticity after long periods of carrying excess weight, and body lift surgery offers a safe and effective way to remove it. Advanced plastic surgery techniques can focus on the upper, mid or lower area of your body to correct the condition that concerns you.

Your diet and exercise or the weight loss surgeries that you have endured have gotten you through the hard work to regain a healthy lifestyle.

#### Qualifying as a Candidate
Your experience in dropping between 30 and 50 percent of your peak weight may qualify you as a potential candidate for body lift chicago.

These guidelines can help you understand the requirements for the surgery.

* Make sure to maintain a stable weight.
  Fluctuations in your weight can affect the results of surgery. It may take a while after you lose a significant amount of weight for your skin to accommodate the loss. The passage of about two years helps ensure a stable weight that enhances your potential as a candidate for surgery.

* Maintain good overall health that can withstand general anesthesia and a period of recovery.
* Commit to a protein-rich diet and a program of exercise that prepare you for surgery and recovery.
* Avoid tobacco completely, and drink alcohol only in moderation if at all.
* Prepare for your body lift with a positive outlook and psychological health. Surgery of any kind requires careful consideration and preparation for physical and          emotional processes to occur.
* Avoid becoming pregnant after your surgery because the stresses that it places on your body can affect the outcomes of your lift.
* Assume a realistic approach about what you can expect from your surgery. The procedure requires incisions which leave scars even though we make them as subtle as possible.
