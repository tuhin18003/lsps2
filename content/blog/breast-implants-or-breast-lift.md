#### Why choose to have breast enhancement surgery?

Breast enhancement surgery is popular for a whole host of reasons and shouldn’t be attributed solely to the idea of wanting to look like a super model. [Breast augmentation](/breast/breast-implants-augmentation) / breast implants, and breast lift surgery can help in all the following areas:

* To enlarge small breasts
* To restore symmetry
* To remove sagging after pregnancy
* To undo the impacts of ageing
* To reshape breasts after other surgeries

Breast enhancement procedures can lift a woman’s self-confidence to extraordinary levels, by just providing better symmetry and shape.  A [breast lift procedure](/breast/breast-lift/) may also aid in daily comfort and relieve uncomfortableness from the weight of sagging breasts.  So, as well as being a cosmetic process, it is very possible that physical benefits will be felt too. 

Still, the full benefits are only unlocked when the right type of treatment is selected.

#### What you need to know about breast implants / breast augmentation

When considering a breast enhancement procedure, breast implants are usually the first option that will be considered. While millions of women jump straight into the idea of having breast implants placed, it’s important to consider some important factors:

>
#### When are breast implants used?

The most common reason for breast implants is to make the breast look bigger while also gaining a fuller shape. If you are looking to gain a bigger bust overall, breast implants are the solution.

Breast implants are suitable for adult women of all ages, unless there are medical reasons to avoid the procedure. However, the vast majority of breast implant procedures are performed on women under the age of 50.

#### Choosing between Saline and Silicone Implants?

When looking at the different type of breast implants on the market, you will need to choose between [silicone and saline implants](/breast/saline-silicone-breast-implants). The Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic Surgery can help you decide which option would be best for you.  


Saline implants are typically more affordable while the smaller incisions generally take less time to heal. However, they are best suited to patients with more natural breast tissue. Women with much smaller breasts and a thin frame may not get the best results with saline implants. 


Silicone implants look very natural but are typically more expensive. Silicone implants need slightly more attention to placement and larger incisions, which may make recovery times a little longer too.

The decision to go with one type over the other can be based on personal preference, body type, or cost.

#### Implant placement and incision options?

Breast implants can be placed under the pectoral muscle (submuscular placement) or under the breast tissue in front of the pectoral muscle (submammary, or subglandular placement). The former takes longer to recover from, but it gives a more natural look.

Incisions are commonly made in one of three places. The options are under the armpit (trans-axillary), the bottom of the areola (periareolar), or under the breast fold (inframammary).

#### How big should I go?

While there is no one right or wrong answer, it’s important to remember that breast implants will change the shape and dimensions of your chest, altering your entire physical dynamic. As such, increasing the breast size by more than two cup sizes could cause comfort issues.

It is important to take your lifestyle and physical health into account when deciding on breast implant surgery.  It is also very important to have realistic expectations about what can be achieved with a breast implant.

#### What you need to know about breast lifts

While breast implants are the type of procedure that most women naturally think about, it isn’t the only solution. Breast lifts are an alternative that can provide a great solution depending on the situation. 

>
#### How do breast lifts differ from breast implants?

Rather than focusing on the size of the breast, breast lift procedures primarily deal with volume and shape. Breast lifts are designed to combat drooping, also known as breast ptosis, and will lift the breast from the nipple to give it a more youthful shape and appearance.

Drooping is very common as women get older while it is also heavily linked to breastfeeding. If you can hold a pencil under the breast fold, a breast lift could be the ideal solution.

#### What is involved in a breast lift surgery?

A breast lift can be achieved by a few incision patterns and techniques.  The contributing factors will be the size and shape of your breast, your skin elasticity, the position of your areolas, and the degree of breast sagging. 

After the proper incision is made the breast tissue is lifted and reshaped, the nipple is repositioned to a more youthful height, and excess skin is removed,and the remaining skin is tightened.

#### Will the results of a breast lift be long lasting?

The results should last indefinitely but may be affected by extreme weight gain or pregnancy.  Gravity will still affect your breasts a bit over time, but only weight fluctuation will cause major changes in the breast appearance following the procedure.
