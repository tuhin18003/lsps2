#### What to Know Before Getting a Mommy Makeover - Chicago

Moms, we applaud you. Few things in life are as fulfilling as having and raising a child, and few things are as challenging. If you’ve found yourself longing to get back in touch with the athletic body you had before pregnancy, the Michael Horn Center of Cosmetic Surgery may be able to help. While it’s not as good as a time machine, a mommy makeover in Chicago is the next best thing. Before you pull the trigger, there are a few things our plastic surgeon wants you to know.

#### One Piece of the Puzzle
While a mommy makeover can do wonders, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. The procedure is meant to help with things you can’t fix on your own, such as excess skin or asymmetrical breasts. Surgery is never a substitute for a healthy diet or regular exercise!

#### It Will Leave a Mark
As with any surgery, this procedure will leave scars. Skilled surgeons have the ability to leave only mild, small scars in discrete areas. If this is a concern for you,be sure to make an appointment with a doctor you trust.

#### Get Plenty of Rest
One thing you can’t forget is to get lots of beauty sleep. A mommy makeover in Chicago is an intensive series of surgical procedures that mandates serious recovery time. Typically, the recovery for a mommy makeover takes at least six weeks. Don’t push yourself to get back to your daily routine too quickly. Use this downtime to recharge and unwind.
