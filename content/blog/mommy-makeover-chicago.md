Motherhood entails pregnancy, which can affect your breasts, legs, tummy, and more. After birthing and nursing your baby, you might start longing for your pre-pregnancy body. Effective methods of transforming the body in shape and size include healthy eating and exercising. You might also consider a mommy makeover to achieve your ideal body.  

#### What’s a Mommy Makeover?
A [Chicago Mommy Makeover](/body/mommy-makeover) is a modern treatment consisting of combined plastic surgery procedures designed to address undesirable physical effects of pregnancy and nursing among women. A mommy makeover helps you achieve an ideal body through a series of safe body contouring processes performed simultaneously. 
A key advantage of mommy makeovers is that procedures are customized to suit the unique needs of each candidate, as every woman is different. However, since most women who have undergone pregnancy and nursing present issues with breasts and tummy, mommy makeovers begin with breast and tummy contouring. Other procedures are included based on necessity. Here is a list of the primary components of mommy makeovers to help you make the life-changing decision.  


#### Breast Lift, Augmentation, or Both
You may be wondering whether you need a [breast lift](/breast/breast-lift) or implants. Whichever the procedure, the goal of a mommy makeover with [breast implants](/breast/breast-implants-augmentation) is to ensure that you are happy with your breasts. Augmentation is necessary if you require additional mass in your breasts to improve shape and achieve the contour that you desire. An increase in breast size is usually needed to correct breast sagging resulting from weight loss through healthy eating and exercise. The end product is an improvement in natural breast size asymmetry.
A breast lift concerns the removal of excess skin and tightening of breast tissue to support the newly acquired breast size and contour. The areola, which tends to increase during pregnancy and nursing, also reduces. A breast lift is advisable when your body exhibits a high degree of skin laxity, and the nipples are at or below the level of your breast fold. Afterwards, you will experience an uplifted, youthful breast profile.  


#### Breast Reduction

Breasts are known to enlarge during pregnancy and nursing to as much as a full cup or more. You might need a reduction in breast volume, also known as mammaplasty, to reduce noticeable sagging. [Breast reduction](/breast/breast-reduction) allows the removal of excess fat, glandular tissue, and skin to ensure that the breast proportion aligns with your body size. The procedure also eliminates the physical and emotional distress associated with overly large breasts or macromastia. With a breast reduction, you can realize your pre-baby figure.  


#### Tummy Tuck

The skin, tissues, and muscles around the tummy stretch to accommodate the baby during pregnancy. However, the muscles might not revert to the pre-pregnancy size and shape after birthing. A [tummy tuck](/body/tummy-tuck) is a form of treatment directed towards firmness and thinness of the abdominal area. The surgeon will remove excess fat, skin, and tissues from the affected area to tighten the abdominal wall. Stretch marks located in the areas where excess skin will be excised also tend to reduce. The results of a tummy tuck are considered as permanent among women with stable body weights. 

#### Liposuction

[Liposuction in Chicago](/body/liposuction) or simply "lipo" addresses issues in different areas of the body, including thighs, arms, tummy, buttocks, back, and face. The treatment utilizes suction technology that breaks down and sucks fat from the body. Although not a recommended weight loss program on its own, a lipo can support your weight loss efforts by removing excess fat deposits from specified body parts. Since liposuction is meant to alter the shape of the body, your natural contour will improve. 

#### Body Lift

A body lift targets the skin, muscles, and tissues in the tummy, buttocks, and thighs. A mommy makeover with a [body lift](/body/body-lift) body lift eliminates sagging skin, excess fat, and irregular or dimpled skin surfaces. A body lift compliments and replaces liposuction when tissue elasticity is poor. You are also an ideal candidate for a body lift if you’re experiencing large amounts of loose hanging skin in the tummy or legs. You will enjoy firm and tight skin afterwards. 

#### Critical Facts about Mommy Makeovers

The outlined procedures fall under outpatient surgery. Surgeons will usually retain you in hospital for the first 24 hours for observation after which home recovery is encouraged. Depending on the extent of the mommy makeover, you can recover in one to four weeks. Recovery requires that you do not engage in strenuous physical activities as you will likely feel bruised and swollen. Seek help to perform essential daily tasks, including taking care of the baby as lifting in sternly discouraged. 

#### Mommy Makeovers are Life-changing

The results of a mommy makeover can be immediate, including a firm waistline, raised breast contour, and tight youthful skin. However, the full benefits are typically acquired a few months after the procedures. Perhaps the most exciting consequence of mommy makeovers is a boost in self- confidence and esteem. Healthy eating and exercise ensure that the results are long-lasting.
