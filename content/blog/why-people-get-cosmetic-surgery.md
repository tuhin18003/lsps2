#### Why People Get Cosmetic Surgery

There are several reasons as to why someone would elect to get cosmetic surgery. Oftentimes, surgery is used to treat physical problems that occurred after an accident or trauma. Weight loss, combatting aging, hair loss and more are all reasons behind getting cosmetic surgery. Procedures such as [Botox](/medspa/botox-cosmetic/), [liposuction](/body/liposuction/), [breast augmentation](/breast/breast-implants-augmentation//), [rhinoplasty](/face/rhinoplasty/), etc., are all common cosmetic surgery options. Whether you want cosmetic surgery for a medical or non-medical reason, there is a procedure that can increase your quality of life.

#### Advancement in Career
In certain career fields your appearance matters, such as news anchors, models, athletes, musicians, politicians, and actors. If you have a career where you are in the public eye you may decide to get cosmetic surgery so that you will look your best when you present yourself to the public. Even if you do not work in one of these fields, an improved appearance gives a better first impression and can give you the boost in confidence you need to move up in your career.

#### Combat Hair Loss
Most hair loss happens due to genetics or as a side effect of the aging process. You can visit a specialist who gives hair transplants to have the appearance of thicker and longer hair without having to resort to pills or other kinds of over-the-counter treatments.

#### Prevent Disease
Another reason some people opt for surgery is to reduce the development of certain diseases or health issues. This is the case with weight loss surgery and procedures, like gastric bypass, as obesity is a leading cause of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. There are even non-surgical options that your cosmetic surgeon may offer, such as UltraShape, that can remove fat from certain areas of your body and improve your overall health.

When considering a cosmetic procedure, think about your reasoning behind it and do plenty of research into the common results and side effects. The surgeon you choose to carry out the procedure is just as important as the procedure itself. Experienced and highly regarded professionals will give you the results you want.
