#### 3 Natural Ways to Improve Your Skin

Your skin is an organ of your body that is on display for the world to see, so it is important that you take the necessary steps to make sure your skin is at its best. Simple steps can have a huge payoff when it comes to your skin. While some patients opt for more drastic procedures such as a facelift in Chicago, there are also measures you can take outside of the doctor’s office to achieve healthy skin.

#### Drinks Lots of Water
Just when you feel like you have had enough water for the day, have another glass! When it comes to your skin, there is no such thing as too much water. Not only is water good for keeping your skin hydrated, but it is also beneficial in ensuring you don’t overeat. You should aim to have at least eight glasses of water every day.

#### Keep Stress Under Control
Stress can play a big part in how your skin looks. As your stress level increases, your hormone production, including cortisol increases and can make your skin oilier. Stress-management techniques such as yoga and deep breathing can really pay off in the long run.

#### Reduce Sun Exposure
Just because you’re inside doesn’t mean you are safe from the sun’s harmful rays. Ultraviolet rays can easily penetrate windows and impact your skin while you are at work or at home. To combat this, wear a face lotion that has SPF in it, so you don’t have to think about wearing additional sunscreen.

There are many ways to keep your skin looking young and healthy, including opting for a facelift in Chicago as well as other natural remedies.
