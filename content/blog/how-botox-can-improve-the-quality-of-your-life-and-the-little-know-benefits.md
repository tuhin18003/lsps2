#### How Botox Can Improve The Quality of Your Life And The Little Know Benefits

Botox injections are some of the most popular cosmetic treatments that are performed within a single office visit. They are used to alleviate certain muscle conditions, but they are more commonly used to remove wrinkles from the face. Since these injections block signals from nerves, muscles are essentially temporarily paralyzed. This makes it possible to decrease fine lines that gather around the eyes, forehead, and mouth. Besides facial improvements, Botox benefits can improve the quality of your life. Here are a few Botox uses and the little-known benefits.

#### Botox for Migraines

Many people suffer debilitating pain from migraines. If you are prone to develop these headaches, Botox injections may be able to help. After the performance of two controlled trials of 1,400 patients, the FDA approved Botox for migraines. If you develop migraines, studies show that Botox lowers the number of days and severity of pain that you will suffer. These trials also show that your quality of life may be improved. Traditionally, migraines have been treated by pharmaceutical means with drugs like Topamax, the leading prescription medication administered for these headaches. Drugs of this nature bring negative side effects, including fatigue and memory impairment. This is not the case with Botox.

Botox blocks certain chemical signals from your body’s nerves, which makes muscles relax. With this form of treatment, your doctor will usually inject Botox every three months. It is common for the injections to be inserted into your nose’s bridge, temples, forehead, neck, or upper back. In positive cases, patients enjoy fewer migraine symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and other sensitivity to their senses. Following treatment, there is no downtime, so you can return to work or regular activities without a problem.

#### Other Botox Uses that May Bring You a Better Life

Botox benefits are plentiful. Here are just a few reasons why this convenient treatment can make a big difference in your life. Results are often instantaneous and require no recovery period.

#### Eliminate Your Fine Lines and Wrinkles

The biggest reason why people receive Botox treatments is to lower the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Botox is a toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum that makes muscles unable to contract. As your muscles relax, wrinkles tend to become less visible. It is a smart way for you to look younger without undergoing an invasive cosmetic surgery.

#### Lift your Face in a Subtle Manner

With time, your face may begin to sag. This is a reason why some people receive facelifts to restore a more youthful look. Unfortunately, not everyone is a good candidate for a facelift. Also, few people want to suffer the pain and recovery of an invasive treatment. When Botox is combined with dermal fillers, you receive subtle lifts to your face. The results appear natural and give you a refreshed look without complications.

#### Combat Your Oily Skin

If you have oily skin, you are probably prone to develop clogged pores, which may cause problems with acne. Also, oily skin often appears shiny and greasy. Who wants to look grimy at work or on an important date? One of the most recent Botox introductions has been microbotox. This form of Botox fights oily skin and reduces the number of visible pores on your face. For a flawless finish, injections are commonly placed into the topical layers of your T-zone.

#### Alter the Shape of Your Face

Everyone has a different facial shape. If you feel that your face is too long or square, Botox may help to create an oval or heart-shaped appearance. Following the way that Botox relaxes muscles, it softens the jaw, which can make your face look more appealing. If you want a refined and more delicate facial shape, Botox may be the answer. It may help slim the face as well.

#### Decrease Sweating

For many years, Botox has been approved by the FDA to stop excessive sweating. Nothing is more embarrassing than large sweat stains under your arms, especially when you are out in public. Hyperhidrosis affects large amounts of people. If you are shy about your sweating issues, Botox can help. As it is injected into your armpits, sweat glands stop perspiring as nerves are blocked. Have you ever been afraid to shake someone’s hand? This type of treatment may be used to stop hands and foreheads from sweating too much as well. The best part is that treatments may last up to one year.

#### Botox Heightens Quality of Life for People with Other Conditions

Botox has been able to help people with various medical conditions so that they enjoy a higher quality of living. For example, if you have a muscle condition like spastic cerebral palsy, you likely have trouble moving, experience uncontrollable muscles, and deal with pain. For this reason, it is difficult to complete everyday activities without a struggle. Also, stroke victims often suffer through issues with their muscles as well.

Usually, cerebral palsy causes muscle stiffness, which leads to spastic movements. Since Botox relaxes muscles, it is an effective way to help people who struggle with this affliction. It calms muscles and stops jerking.

Botox has helped people who have experienced strokes as well. A study performed in 2005 at the Indiana University School of Medicine showed that repeated Botox treatments improve muscle tone and lessen pain in stroke victims, especially in the arms and hands. This helps them to perform regular activities like dressing, washing and feeding themselves.
