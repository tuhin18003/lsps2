#### Lose Fat and Build Muscle With Emsculpt Body Contouring
If you’re struggling to get rid of stubborn body fat to reveal a trim waist, tone stomach, and slimmer hips, Emsculpt Body Sculpting offers a solution. This FDA-approved, non-invasive body contouring treatment delivers fat burning and muscle toning for body perfection that requires zero downtime, giving you that bikini body you’ve always dreamed of.
Diet and exercise can only go so far, but Emsculpt Body Contouring has the ability to sculpt curves and give you shape where you want it most. Learn more about this revolutionary treatment that’s taking Chicago by storm and delivering amazing results.

#### How Does Emsculpt Work?
A revolution in body sculpting procedures, Emsculpt uses state-of-the-art technology to tone your body and burn fat, revealing a tone stomach and slim curves. 
Its name is actually derived from the science that fuels it, with the letters E and M referring to the electromagnetic energy that contracts the muscles in the treatment area. This provides your muscles with a strong contraction that mimics the body’s natural contractions but is much stronger than a voluntary contraction could achieve. 
Emsculpt induces roughly 20,000 muscle contractions per session, which is the equivalent of doing 20,000 squats or crunches in the same time frame. Unlike a strenuous workout, however, Emsculpt accelerates muscle recovery, and most patients only feel slight muscle soreness and fatigue. 
When exposed to such strong contractions, the muscles adapt by deep remodeling of the deeper structures that accelerate muscle toning and fat burning, giving you beautiful, picture-perfect results.

#### How Is Emsculpt Different From Other Non-Surgical Body Sculpting or Fat-Removal Procedures?
Conventional body sculpting procedures use ultrasound, laser, radiofrequency, and other technologies to disrupt the fat cells in the body, causing them to break down and dissolve. Emsculpt is radically different than these procedures in that it actually tones muscles to break down fat, mimicking the results from normal exercise. It is the first technology of its kind that works by targeting the underlying muscle, rather than the fat stores above. 
It’s also FDA-approved for the strengthening, toning and firming of the abdominal area, buttocks and hips, delivering superior contouring results that conventional treatments can’t match.

#### Who Is a Good Candidate for Emsculpt?

Though Emsculpt is FDA-approved, safe and non-invasive, it’s not the ideal procedure for everyone. The ideal Emsculpt candidate is already in relatively good shape and looking for extra definition in the abdomen, buttocks and thighs that can’t be reached through strict diet and exercise alone.
Emsculpt works for both men and women and is a popular option for patients recovering from injury. Athletes and otherwise fit patients recovering from sports injuries or chronic back or joint concerns are limited in their ability to exercise, but Emsculpt can help tone the areas that can’t be reached through other workouts and keep the affected muscle groups strong and fit.
With its muscle-toning technology, Emsculpt can build a strong core, which is vital to balance, fitness and overall health. The body’s core is a collection of muscles, bones, joints and tendons within the chest, abdomen, lower back, hips and pelvis, all of which impact the movement and adjoining muscle groups in the upper and lower body. For individuals with bad posture from prolonged sitting or standing, back pain, physical weakness and fatigue caused by weak core muscles, the core strengthening of Emsculpt can make a huge difference. A fit core keeps the body flexible and strong, while also enhancing the movement in the musculoskeletal system and preventing injury.
It’s also a great solution to lose stubborn “baby weight” after pregnancy,which can be difficult to lose due to hormone fluctuations, breastfeeding and physical changes to the body. If you'd like to consider further body shaping after pregnancy we recommend our amazing  [Chicago Mommy Makeover](/body/mommy-makeover) for the look and feel you've missed throughout your pregnancy..

#### How Long Does Emsculpt Take?

Each Emsculpt treatment is broken into 30-minute sessions on a particular area of the body, such as the abdomen or buttock. It’s a non-invasive, non-surgical procedure with no post-operative treatment or recovery. Each treatment area will need a separate treatment session. 
Four treatment sessions within a two-week period are recommended to achieve results like:<br><br>
* Lifted and toned buttocks and hips.<br>
* Shapely curves and definition in buttocks.<br>
* Toned, defined abdominal muscles.<br>
* Core strength.<br>

Though an immediate change in muscle tone and body fat are noticeable after the first treatment, the full result of the Emsculpt treatment is visible several weeks following the last session. Studies have shown a 15- to 20-percent growth in muscle and reduction of fat after a round of Emsculpt treatments. 
One of the greatest advantages of the Emsculpt treatment is its long-lasting results. Once the maximum fat loss and muscle growth are achieved, the results can be maintained with regular diet and exercise to keep the muscles strong and avoid fat gain. Depending on the previous body condition, Emsculpt results, and fitness plan, it’s possible to achieve permanent results with healthy eating and regular physical activity. 
Patients can also choose to receive Emsculpt treatments on a maintenance basis, which can vary by body condition and desired results. Maintenance visits are less frequent than the initial visit, but the results are seen immediately and become progressively improved in the following months.
