#### Waxing vs. Laser Hair Removal in Chicago

Both women and men are sometimes unhappy with the placement or amount of hair that naturally occurs on their bodies. Thankfully, there are options to get rid of unwanted hair both temporarily and permanently, including the option of laser hair removal in Chicago. Here are the major differences between waxing and laser hair removal that can help you make your decision on what is right for you.

#### Permanence
If you are getting a wax, you can expect that area of your body to stay smooth for around two weeks. On the other hand, laser hair removal is permanent, meaning there won’t be additional worries about hair growing back in the future.

#### How Fast Results Appear
You’ll be able to see and feel the results of a hair wax immediately, while it may take up to six sessions in order for laser hair removal in Chicago to become fully effective. Patience is key when it comes to laser hair removal, but the results that come from it are priceless if you don’t want to have to worry about hair removal in the future.

#### How It Works
Waxing pulls your hair out at its root, allowing your hair to once again grow from that root in the future. Laser hair removal destroys the hair follicle as a whole through a pulsed light.
