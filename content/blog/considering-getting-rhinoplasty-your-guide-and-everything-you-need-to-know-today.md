### Considering Getting Rhinoplasty, Your Guide and Everything You Need to Know Today

#### Complete Rhinoplasty Guide
If you are considering surgically altering the appearance of your nose, you’re not alone. Rhinoplasty is the third most popular cosmetic procedure according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. This procedure is often referred to as a nose job. This surgical practice is utilized in order to reshape the external appearance of the nose. This can help bring symmetry to the face by improving the size and shape of the nose.

In addition, nasal surgery may be done in order to help patients with breathing problems. These issues may stem from a deviated septum or an injury that caused a disruption in normal breathing patterns. Therefore, nasal surgery is not always performed just for aesthetic purposes.

#### Consultation

The initial step to your procedure will begin with a consultation with your surgeon. Choosing a surgeon with experience in facial cosmetic procedures is important. You may ask to review before and after pictures of the surgeon’s prior patients to evaluate their work. Results should look natural and meet the expectation that you want to achieve after surgery. Consultation is an excellent time to ask your surgeon any questions you may have. It is normal to experience some anxiety about the procedure or to experience some stress about rhinoplasty recovery time. This time allows for you to work through any uncertainties with your surgeon to help you fully understand and appreciate the process.

During your consultation, you should be prepared to discuss your goals for this surgery, whether it pertains to your aesthetics or your breathing. In addition, you will want to discuss any pertinent medical conditions, the medication you are taking or allergies you may have. The surgeon will also ask about any previous surgeries you may have undergone. These are important pieces of information that your surgeon will use to individualize your procedure to ensure the best results.

The surgeon will be able to answer your questions or provide you with valuable information about your concerns. Your surgeon will also go over the process of preparing for your surgery, the process of the procedure and what you can expect after the surgery is complete. It is important to understand that while the surgery is typically done in an outpatient setting, most individuals prefer to take at least 2 weeks off from work or school. The healing process is an important component of this cosmetic procedure and should be taken seriously. Furthermore, questions about healing and recovery can be addressed during this initial consultation.

#### What Can a Rhinoplasty Procedure Treat?

Patients may wonder if their specific issue can be properly addressed with a nasal surgery procedure. This is a highly personalized surgery, however, most individuals who experience the following conditions are ideal candidates:

* Asymmetry: This occurs when the nose is distorted or deviated.
* Dorsal hump: This is a clear arched shape to the bridge of the nose. This gives the appearance of a bump or curve on the nose.
* Nasal span: This is simply categorized by a nose that has too much, or not enough width to be in proportion with the rest of the face.
* Protruding nasal tip: This is characterized by a nasal tip that is bulbous or round and is not in proportion with other facial features.
* Nasal tip pitosis: This is characterized by a nose tip dropping below the axis along the bottom of the nose.
* Post injury irregularities: This refers to shape variances after an injury to the nose.
* Airway complications: Most notably, these issues will arise with a deviated septum or valve collapse.

#### Preparing for Surgery

It is important to properly prepare for surgery and follow the recommendations given to you by your surgeon. Avoiding things like smoking, consuming caffeine and alcohol can help better ensure recovery goes smoothly. Avoiding irritants such as the ones mentioned before will allow your body to be adequately prepared to heal. In addition, your surgeon will likely give you recommendations on what to do to help reduce swelling and bruising post-surgery.

#### Procedure

During this procedure, an overly large nose can be reshaped by removal of bone or cartilage. On the contrary, some patients may need cartilage grafts added to their nose. These grafts often come from the septum, but may be taken from the ear, if needed. If the surgery is being performed due to a deviated septum, it can be straightened and any barriers within the nose can be improved in order to advance normal breathing patterns and reduce congestion.

All face plastic surgeries are very personalized and are performed according to each patient’s needs. This is important to ensure everyone receives the results that they desire. Because of this, there are a couple different methods for completing a cosmetic procedure on the nose. In general, the surgery will be performed using an open or closed method. These methods differ in their extensiveness and depend on the severity of the issue to be corrected.

* Closed Technique
  With this type of procedure, incisions are performed on the interior of the nostrils. This type of surgical treatment is well suited for individuals who only need slight modification or reshaping. There is no observable scarring after this form of rhinoplasty as the incisions are located within the nostrils. This method may not work well for those who require more extensive enhancements.
* Open Technique
  An open styled procedure allows the surgeon much more access to the nasal structures. This is done by the use of a small incision located between the nostrils, under the tip of the nose. The nose can then be shaped and sculpted. This approach is well suited for those who require extensive reshaping of the nose. The remaining scar will be positioned in the natural silhouette of the nose and is very well hidden because of this.
* Nasal Tip Plasty
  This type of procedure does not focus on incision methods, but rather the reshaping of the nasal tip. Some individuals may have a very large or bulbous tip of the nose, which does not match other features of their face. This method of cosmetic enhancement is specific to the tip of the nose and does not deal with other nasal structures. The tip of the nose can be reshaped to create appropriate angles between the lip and the nose by giving the tip of the nose a lift. This lift will help reduce the overall size of the tip of the nose and will create more harmony regarding proportions of the facial features.
* Non-Surgical
  In addition to the aforementioned techniques, it is possible to correct the shape of the nose by the use of dermal fillers. These fillers can provide results that last up to a year. This type of procedure is done by injecting filler at various points in the nose to create a more symmetrical appearance. A surgeon can perform this technique to smooth out bumps, sculpt the tip of the nose, and improve overall symmetry. This is considered a non-surgical procedure and can be great for individuals who want to reshape their nose, but are not yet committed to the surgical process.

#### Post-Surgery Expectations

As with other face plastic surgeries, this type of surgery is most often performed in an outpatient setting utilizing general anesthesia. However, intravenous sedation may be more fitting with certain cases. After the procedure, a splint will likely be placed and secured over your nose. This splint will help support and protect your nose as it heals. This can be very important as unintentional movement or contact of the nose can cause unintended movement in the bone or cartilage that was operated on.

In addition, you may be released to go home with packing inside your nose. This can be very uncomfortable, but it is only a temporary means to provide internal support and control bleeding. This packing will likely be removed within the first week after the procedure.

You will visit your surgeon a few days after your surgery. During this visit, your bandages and dressings will be removed. Your surgeon will evaluate your nose and ensure it is beginning the healing process. This is a great time to ask any questions you might have following the procedure. You will be prescribed some form of pain medicine by your surgeon to help reduce your pain and discomfort while you heal.

#### First Few Weeks After Surgery

Rhinoplasty recovery time can vary from case to case. It is highly recommended to listen to the needs of your body and take it easy your first couple of weeks post-surgery. When you are recovering, it is important to keep the head elevated. Cold compress may help elevate swelling. You may experience moderate swelling as well as bruising. Bruising will be more prominent if the surgical work was completed on the bone. This inflammation can make it difficult to see the improvements accomplished with your procedure. Thankfully, the majority of the swelling and bruising should dissipate within two weeks. Most people feel ready to return to their normal activities after a couple of weeks. However, it is important to listen to your surgeon regarding the activities you may resume or hold off on.

#### Final Results

Your new nose can take a while to make its concluding appearance, as you may still have residual swelling for quite some time. While this small amount of swelling is usually not noticed by others, it may be difficult to adjust to for yourself. The full healing process can take up to a year as the swelling decreases, scar tissue increases and then begins to diminish over the next several months.

#### Overview

A nasal cosmetic surgery can be a great benefit to those who want to improve the shape and size of their nose. The surgery will be performed in such a way to minimize scars or any visible aftermath from surgery. Dr. Michael Horn can help guide you in which procedure type is recommended for your specific needs and will address any concerns you may have. Your surgeon will evaluate many different aspects to ensure that you are an ideal candidate for this procedure. If you are found to not be an ideal candidate, your surgeon will likely recommend other treatment options that will help your specific issue.

Healing after a nasal procedure may vary slightly from person to person, but is generally expected to take 2 weeks for the patient to feel “normal”. This is usually the amount of time individuals choose to take off from work or school. This helps ensure that they are able to fully focus on healing after their procedure is performed. It is important to note, it may take up to a year for your complete and final results to emerge. However, you will get a sense of what your new nose will look like as soon as the initial swelling and inflammation is reduced.

Making the decision to undergo a nasal cosmetic procedure is nothing to take lightly. It is important to fully understand the benefits, as well as the risks, and possible disadvantages before making a final decision. Nasal cosmetic surgery can be an excellent choice for some individuals, but may not be recommended for your specific situation. Therefore, it is important to consult your surgeon to conduct a thorough and complete evaluation of your nose and overall physical health in regards to a possible nasal procedure. This will ensure you are provided with the best information regarding your situation and will allow you to make an informed decision about what to do moving forward.
