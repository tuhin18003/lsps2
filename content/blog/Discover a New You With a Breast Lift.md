### Discover a New You With a Breast Lift
As you age, it’s natural for your breasts to lose some of the youthful perkiness and contour that you once enjoyed. While exercise and push-up bras can offer a temporary improvement, the fact is that your breasts may still sag more than you want them to.

Fortunately, it’s possible to restore the firm and perky breasts you once had. You can opt for [breast implants ](/breast/breast-implants-augmentation/), but not all women wish to have the natural shape of their breasts enlarged or changed. If you simply want to have the sexy, youthful figure you’re missing when you look in the mirror, you are likely a perfect candidate for a breast lift.

#### What Can a Breast Lift Do?

You may see breast lifts referred to as mastopexy by Chicago plastic surgeons. This is just the medical term for the procedure. In addition to those who want a perkier chest, a Chicago mastopexy is also ideal for women who have slightly asymmetrical or unusually shaped breasts.

Whether you’ve had children, undergone significant weight loss or are simply getting older, the shape and positioning of your breasts can change drastically. With a breast lift, Chicago women can improve their natural cleavage, increase upper breast fullness and restore their breasts to a naturally higher position on the chest.

When breasts begin to migrate downward, it can often cause stretch marks, a change in areola shape and a shift in nipple positioning. This is usually not ideal, and it can make any woman self-conscious about how she looks naked. A breast lift can help to eliminate these issues as well.

In the end, you’ll be left with firmer, perkier breasts that look youthful and natural. A breast lift is an easy way to enhance your natural curves and make you look and feel sexier.

#### How Does the Procedure Work?

During your initial consultation, you will be able to have a conversation with your plastic surgeon about the things you hope to change about your breasts. He or she will then be able to give you a better idea of whether or not your goals can be achieved with just a breast lift.

Breast lifts can be performed alone or alongside other breast enhancing procedures, such as [breast augmentation ](/breast/breast-implants-augmentation/) or reduction surgery. What you choose to do will depend on your unique situation and your aesthetic goals.

For a breast lift Chicago surgeons will perform a few tasks. First, your surgeon will remove the excess and stretched-out skin in the breast area. Next, he or she will reshape your existing breast tissue and raise your nipples and areola into a higher, more forward position.

#### Is a Breast Lift Right For Me?

Breast lifts, like all cosmetic procedures, are a personal choice. When you meet with your plastic surgeon, you will be able to outline exactly what you hope your end results will be. Once your plastic surgeon understands your goals and is able to assess your overall health, he or she will be able to tell you honestly if a breast lift is the right choice for you.

In many cases, women are extremely happy with their post-surgery results. However, if you have goals that go beyond the scope of what a breast lift can achieve, your plastic surgeon should give you alternative options or help you decide on complementary procedures.

If you meet one or more of the following criteria, you are likely a good candidate for a breast lift:

* Your breasts are sagging or drooping.
* You have flat or elongated breasts.
* Your nipples point downward.
* You are not pregnant or breastfeeding.
