#### Larsa Pippen Talks UltraShape - Chicago Plastic Surgeon Dr. Michael Horn M.D.

Larsa Pippen, wife of NBA Hall of Famer and mother of four, can’t stop gushing to everyone she knows about UltraShape.

She says “UltraShape gives me more confidence. I eat well and exercise regularly, but there are certain areas that are resistant to all my efforts. With UltraShape, the inches are disappearing. I lost 1.5 inches – and I love my results so much that even my mom and my friends are doing it.”

UlraShape involves no pain, helping men and women achieve a flatter stomach without fasting, extreme exercising, or liposuction. So how does it work? You lie down while a technician glides the handpiece gently over your stomach while it delivers ultrasound energy into your fat cells. While this is happening, you can play on your phone, listen to music or even take a nap during the process.

[Dr. Michael Horn](/about) is one of the first to offer [UltraShape in Chicago](/medspa/ultrashape/). Says Horn, “UltraShape uses pulsed, focused ultrasound waves to target and destroy fat cells without harming the surrounding tissues. It breaks up the fatty material inside the cells that gets absorbed by the body naturally. The great thing is that there’s no pain or downtime, and you can get back to normal activities right away.”
