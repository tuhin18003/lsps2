Luckily, at the Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic Surgery, we are well-versed in vein treatment in Chicago and we can help you eliminate veins and restore the confidence you thought you no longer had. Both spider veins and varicose veins can be approached in a multitude of ways, and the approach typically depends on the type and the severity of your veins.

#### Laser Vein Removal
Laser vein removal is a popular option because it is minimally invasive compared to other options. Through highly concentrated beams of light energy, both spider veins and varicose veins can be removed. Plus, no general anesthesia is necessary.

#### Sclerotherapy
Another popular option for vein treatment in Chicago is sclerotherapy. This means that there is a solution that is injected directly into your veins that turns them to turn white or fade, eventually disappearing. Sclerotherapy is especially helpful for eliminating spider veins.
