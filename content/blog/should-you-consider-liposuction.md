#### Should You Consider Liposuction?

For whatever reason, you may have excess fat deposits in certain areas of your body that you would rather get rid of. Oftentimes, people take advantage of this surgery after significant weight loss, after giving birth, or are combining it with other procedures such as a mommy makeover or removal of excess skin (such as in the case of weight loss).

[Liposuction](/body/liposuction/) has specific requirements in who is a candidate for this procedure. A person must not have too much excess skin, as well as have decent skin elasticity. While liposuction is great for removing fat deposits, it does not tighten your skin. You should also not be more than twenty pounds overweight; if you are looking to liposuction to loose weight, you should consult with your surgeon for a different option.

Body contouring offers significant benefits because it allows for fit people to tone the already great body they have. Oftentimes, people work hard for the body they have through diet and exercise. However, the nature of the human body is that fat deposits sometimes stick, no matter how hard you work to get rid of them. Liposuction is performed with minimal invasion, just some small incisions, leading to marginal scarring.

There are multiple types of liposuction available; you will want to schedule a consultation with an experienced plastic surgeon to decide upon what is right for you. If you are seriously considering liposuction to smooth and tone your body, contact Dr. Michael Horn for all of your plastic surgery needs in Chicago.
