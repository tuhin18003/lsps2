#### Benefits of Laser Hair Removal in Chicago

For many people, hair removal is a time-consuming daily routine. While traditional methods, such as shaving, are effective for removing hair, they do not provide a long-term solution. At the Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic Surgery, our goal is to get you looking and feeling your best, which is why we offer laser hair removal in Chicago.

#### Cost Effective
While [laser hair removal Chicago](/medspa/laser-hair-removal/) is costly upfront, it will save you money in the long run. No longer will you have to spend money on wax treatments, creams, razors or other methods used to remove hair. You will also save yourself a great deal of time that would otherwise be spent on shaving or waxing. Over the past few years, the cost of laser hair removal has decreased, and the cost of waxing has increased.

#### Precise and Preventative
Laser hair removal is a great option because it targets hair right down to the follicle. Unlike waxing, you don’t need to wait for surface hairs for a laser hair removal treatment. In fact, you are encouraged to shave before your session to prevent scorching of surface hair. Laser hair removal will also eliminate and prevent pesky ingrown hairs.

#### Fast and Effective
Laser hair removal sessions are usually fast, and results can be seen as early as the second treatment. Most patients can achieve hair loss within 3-7 sessions. Laser hair removal in Chicago drastically reduces hair growth – to the point that you can stop shaving the area altogether.
