#### How Botox Fights Aging Signs

Botox is an injection that dermatologists give to patients who wish to get rid of aging signs around the mouth, corners of the eyes and near the cheek area. As we age, we lose the collagen needed to maintain youthful skin. Therefore, when you get these treatments, you can restore some of the collagen that is lost due to the aging process. The aging process doesn’t just start when you reach your 50s; some in their 30s and 40s may begin noticing the signs as well. Keep reading to learn more about this procedure.

#### Minimal Side Effects

You may think that [Botox](/medspa/botox-cosmetic/) will cause negative side effects, but this is not the case. In fact, it is safe to use and although you may experience slight discomfort after the treatment such as pain and tightness around the facial area, these symptoms will last only a few minutes.

#### Many Benefits

Botox helps fight aging, but it can also be used for other purposes. These include treating migraine headaches, muscle spasms around the neck, crossed eyes, overactive bladder and crow’s feet. If you have certain medical conditions or allergies, you should talk with your doctor to determine if these treatments are safe for you.

#### See Results in Days

You will begin to see a change in your appearance within four days of your treatment. Because it is not a permanent solution to fighting aging signs, you will have to have this treatment every few months or so to maintain a youthful look. Your [cosmetic surgeon](/about) or dermatologist can recommend how often you should get Botox to achieve your desired results.

This is an amazing and effective treatment that restores youthfulness to your skin, and improves confidence in your appearance. Gone are the days when you had to settle for living with wrinkled, aging skin.
