#### Prevent Sagging Breasts

As we get older, our skin becomes less elastic. While this is a normal part of aging, premature sagging can be prevented to a certain degree by quitting four habits. If you regularly do any of these, it’s time to stop in order to prevent sagging breasts!

#### A Lack of Oxygen: 
Although this one probably goes without saying, smoking is one of the worst things you can do for your health-including your skin! Your skin ages much faster when you smoke, and your skin becomes weakened because the chemicals decrease the blood supply to the skin surface.

#### A Lack of Support: 
Any woman that has large breasts knows that a sturdy bra can do wonders for your back, shoulders, and confidence. In addition to these benefits, it can help prevent premature sagging! Finding a supportive bra decreases the stress the collagen in your breasts experience, meaning that not only do they look perkier, they actually are.

#### A Lack of Protection: 
Along with smoking, one health mishap that can lead to dire consequences is avoiding sunscreen. When the sun is out, sunscreen should be your best friend. The sun, though it feels great on your skin, harms more than it helps. UV ray exposure can cause early wrinkles and damage; it also stretches out the collagen in your skin, leading to breast sagging.

#### A Lack of Food: 
Crash dieting should be avoided at all costs. Yes, women will fluctuate five pounds or so, which is no problem. However, if you keep gaining and losing the same twenty or more pounds, your body and skin will not respond well. Your breast tissue in particular will become more and more slack, like a cheap sweater that goes through the wash.

To prevent sagging breasts, you’ll have to go back in time to when you were twenty. However, there are preventative measures you can take to keep your breasts looking their age. In general, being healthy and taking care of yourself will do the trick. There are some factors, such as genetics, that you cannot control. Contact The Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic Surgery if you think that a breast lift is right for you.
