#### Plastic Surgery for Men

Traditionally, plastic surgery has been geared towards women. However, people of both genders are going to have problem areas or need cosmetic surgery for certain issues. Both men and women can experience dramatic weight loss and need a tummy tuck; both men and women may want medical spa treatments, and plastic surgery is not just for women. Plastic surgery for men has become much more common, even at The Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic Surgery!

#### Services Offered
Though our offices specialize in breast surgery, there are many services that men can also reap the benefits of, such as [male breast reduction](/formen/male-breast-reduction/) or [Gynecomastia Surgery](/formen/male-breast-reduction/). Many of the skin care options offered at our med spa, such as [Botox](/medspa/botox-cosmetic/), are used by men also. In addition, more invasive procedures, like [rhinoplasty](/face/rhinoplasty/), [face lift](/face/facelift/), and more, are services that men come to our offices for. Men are more and more willing to utilize the services available to them, knowing the amazing results it provides.

#### At Our Medspa
Men may not be enticed by laser hair removal, but plenty of our other medspa services are perfect for those looking for a non-invasive way to improve the way they look and feel. From facials to vein therapy, procedures that require little to no recovery are attracting more men than ever. Treatments are available to help with sun damage, acne, mild cases of rosacea, wrinkles, and more. The opportunities are endless for plastic surgery for men!

Have you always wanted to tweak something about your body? Nowadays, men and women have the access to procedures that can help you achieve the results you have always wanted. Schedule an appointment with The Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic Surgery for a consultation!
