#### What is Gynecomastia?

Gynecomastia is the benign enlargement of breast tissue in men. Gynecomastia surgery, also known as male breast reduction, is the correction of breast tissue that is over-developed.
Causes of gynecomastia include hormone imbalance, hypothyroidism, liver disease, aging, and the use of certain medications. Whatever the cause, gynecomastia can have an unfortunate negative impact on the physical and emotional lives of the men who suffer from it.

#### Healing and Recovery

After your surgery, bandages will be placed over your incisions and you may be fitted with a surgical drain to remove excess fluids. If there is a drain placed, it will be removed in a day or two. You will be given support garments to protect your chest while the healing takes place.  You will be prescribed medication that will ensure proper healing and prevent infection. Occasionally check your incisions for any redness, oozing, or inflammation. Any signs of infection or irregular healing should be reported to your doctor immediately.
