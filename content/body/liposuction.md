#### Common Problem Areas

* Abdomen – As we age, it is no question many of us struggle to keep our tummy’s tight. An abdomen liposuction treatment can not only help remove the excess fat from your stomach region, but also around your waist and back areas-creating an overall slimmer and shapely result.
* Hips – Hips can easily gain fat, but not so easily lose it. Whether you want to take a few inches off your hips or if you want to further define your silhouette, liposuction is a great option for you.
* Inner & Out Thighs – Your thighs are a difficult place to lose fat, which makes liposuction an ideal procedure to take off inches and improve confidence in your legs. If you are uncomfortable with the silhouette of your legs, it is recommended to get liposuction on your inner and outer thighs for symmetry and proportional reasons.
* Calves & Knees – Thick calves can be a thing of the past with a liposuction procedure from The Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic Surgery. Our efficient liposuction techniques will ensure your calves are tailored to perfection. If your also carry excess fat around your knee caps, a liposuction treatment can tuck this away and create a thinner, smoother effect.
