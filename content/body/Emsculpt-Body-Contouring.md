#### Importance of Core Strength

Our body’s core is a set of muscles, bones, joints and tendons vital to healthy strength and mobility. The core includes the chest, abdomen, lower back, pelvis and hips, and plays an integral role in the function of almost every muscle group from our upper to our lower extremities. A fit and healthy core allows our body’s musculoskeletal system to work naturally and can prevent injury while keeping us strong, flexible and energetic.

#### Signs of Core Problems

Although you should always get diagnosed by a certified physician for your symptoms, these several issues may be the result of a weak or injured core:
		
Bad Posture — having a bad posture can be a telltale sign of a weak and impaired core. Slumped shoulders and always standing or sitting in slouched position are common symptoms of having a weak core.
			
Back Pain — a lack of core strength can cause back pain when the abdominal muscles are not strong enough to provide proper support for their opposing back muscles. This leaves the back muscles overburdened and exposed to excessive work, pain and injury.
			
A General Feeling of Weakness — our core is so vital to our strength and mobility that a weak core can leave the rest of our body’s muscles challenged by activity. If you feel abnormally weak when lifting objects or performing basic movements such as running or jumping, a weakened core may be your issue.
			
Lack of Energy / Fatigue — a weak core can cause us to feel tired quickly and strained by basic physical movement and exercise. Many symptoms of poor stamina,endurance and a lack of energy are the result of a weak core.

#### How EMSCULPT Works

In the past, a machine procedure that claimed to burn fat and build muscle seemed more like a gimmick than reality. Today, leading-edge research has brought about the development of HIFEM® — High-Intensity Focused Electromagnetic energy used by the EMSCULPT. HIFEM® is a proprietary technology that stimulates supramaximal muscle contractions in the target area, giving you a fast and powerful muscle workout in the comfort of a relaxed position. This technology is so effective that the result of a single session can be the equivalent of as many as 20,000 crunches or squats within 30 minutes!

Even with such intensity, EMSCULPT is engineered to be a comfortable procedure and does not require any post-treatment downtime or recovery.

Intense (supramaximal) muscle contractions are applied to the target area, which cannot be achieved through exercise
		
Your muscle tissue adapts to supramaximal contractions, creating more tone and definition
		
Supramaximal muscle contractions strengthen and build muscle while destroying fat, providing greater definition and muscle contour for your ideal shape

#### “Lunch-time” Treatment, Rapid Results!

EMSCULPT is a non-invasive, nonsurgical procedure and requires no pre/post treatment preparation or recovery time after treatment. Your session will consist of lying in a relaxed position while the machine is fitted to your abdomen or buttocks. A stimulated workout will be applied to the target area for 30 minutes, which will feel like you are performing an intense and rewarding workout — while remaining perfectly comfortable. After treatment, you can go about your daily activities such as work without worrying about recovery or downtime.

#### How Quickly Can I Expect Results?

Many patients experience feeling positive results after just one treatment, such as strength and stability. However, optimal and visible results are generally achieved after the fourth session and will improve for several weeks after treatment. To maximize the effects of EMSCULPT, do your best to maintain a regular exercise routine and healthy diet and lifestyle.
