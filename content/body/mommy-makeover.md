We counsel women to help them understand the changes that have occurred and how getting a mommy makeover can help restore the look they once had, helping to boost their self-confidence and feel more comfortable in their new bodies.

#### The Changes of Pregnancy

During pregnancy, your body will experience a number of transformations that can leave it out of shape and potentially scarred. Some of the most frequent changes women go through include an over-stretched abdomen, overall weight gain, enlarged breasts and more. A pregnant body is indeed beautiful, but when this time is over, you may feel your body isn’t what you want. As your breasts shrink back down, they may lose some of their shape and sag. You may find your abdomen never flattens and has stretch marks. You may even find stretch marks elsewhere on your body. What can you do? A Mommy Makeover in can be just the solution you need.

#### What Does It Include?

A Mommy Makeover can be just about anything you need it to be. Our cosmetic surgeons will sit down with you and go over the changes that occurred that need our attention. We can help you determine which procedures should be part of your makeover. For many women, a [Breast Augmentation](/breast/breast-implants-augmentation/) is the best way to resolve sagging breasts and restore them to their former size and level of perkiness. Some of the other common procedures included in this makeover include [Liposuction](/breast/breast-implants-augmentation/) to remove unwanted patches of fat, body sculpting to change the contour of your body and abdominoplasty to reduce the pouch you may have been left with. We can help you reshape your body so you can love yourself all over again. This is why one of the first things we will do is sit down with you and go over what you expect from your mommy makeover. Then our Chicago surgical team will put together a treatment plan that is most likely to achieve the results you’re looking for. We will help you restore your body to it’s previous glory.

#### When to Have Your Makeover

Many women aren’t sure when to undergo their Mommy Makeover. Some women want their body back as soon as they are done with their first pregnancy. However, if you plan on having more children, it’s often best to wait and have the procedure done after you are completely done having children. Getting these procedures done and having more children will often reverse the benefits so you need to undergo the procedures again. Even if you are done having children, it is often best to wait until you have lost all of the baby weight, which can take at least a year. Waiting will ensure your Mommy Makeover provides the results you are looking for!
