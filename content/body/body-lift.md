Patients often find themselves with more energy, improved self-confidence, and a greater quality of life. Unfortunately, excess sagging skin may also result from extreme weight loss.

#### What is a Body Lift?

A body lift is a procedure that removes fat and sagging skin to improve the tone and shape of the tissue that supports the skin. They arenâ€™t intended for strictly fat removal, but rather to improve tissue elasticity. Poor tissue elasticity and skin sagging can be caused by various factors including aging, pregnancy, sun damage, weight fluctuations, and genetic factors.

#### When Will I See Results?

While some results will be visible almost immediate after the procedure, it will take a significant amount of time for the final results to fully develop. You will have some permanent visible scarring but overall results should be long lasting.
