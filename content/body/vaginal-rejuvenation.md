#### The Technology behind Core Intima 
{{%/ content %}}

Vaginal Rejuvenation treatment at the Michael Horn Center utilizes CO2 laser technology to treat multiple tissue layers and locations safely and simultaneously. CO2 lasers are considered safe and effective—particularly in the treatment of vaginal tissue — and allow physicians to treat external, internal and introitus vaginal tissue with delicate precision and care. CO2 lasers have also been proven to reshape and restore tissue in atrophic skin by promoting collagen and elastic fiber growth. 

With CO2RE Intima, physicians are able to target superficial and subsurface skin tissue at the same time, while controlling the intensity, ablation, and treatment pattern unique to specific tissue type and location. Each and every Core Intima procedure is performed with single-use, sterile equipment designed to ensure optimal hygiene and safety for our patients.
