highlightedText : "As you age, you may see sagging or loose skin that creates a visible bulge in your tummy. For women, this may occur after pregnancy because the muscles and skin in the area have been stretched. At our Chicago Cosmetic Surgery Center, we perform an abdominoplasty, or tummy tuck, to create a flatter, proportionate midsection, as well as to reduce this bulging in the tummy. Usually performed under general anesthesia, the tummy tuck takes approximately two hours to complete. You may experience some side effects temporarily, including soreness, pain, swelling, bruising and numbness. However, most patients can return to light activity and even work in as little as two to four weeks.

![Tummy Tuck after pregnancy](../../images/body/tummy-tuck-example.jpg "tummy tuck")

Many women lose their abdominal muscle strength and gain excess skin as a result of having children. As a result of their childbirth, they have acquired a belly that sticks out disproportionately to the rest of their body. In other words, they look in the mirror and see a sagging, loose-skinned belly that sticks out. A post-pregnancy tummy tuck can help get your pre-pregnancy tummy back, and now is a great time to start thinking seriously about that tummy tuck. Click Here to Learn More About Getting A Tummy Tuck After Pregnancy. It can be difficult for women to deal with the changes that take place in their body after pregnancy and childbirth. Giving the gift of a tummy tuck in Chicago can help a woman feel more confident and grow to love her body once again.

Children are a gift, but pregnancy can take a toll on a woman’s body. Some women find it impossible to achieve their pre-pregnancy weight primarily because of their abdominal region. If this is your situation, a tummy tuck could be a great solution for you.

#### YOUR TUMMY TUCK CONSULTATION

![Chicago Tummy Tuck Surgeon](../../images/body/tummy-tuck-example-2.jpg "tummy tuck procedure")


The first step to take when considering getting an abdominoplasty or tummy tuck is to give Dr. Horn’s office a call and schedule a consultation. During your abdominoplasty consultation at our Chicago Cosmetic Surgery Center, Dr. Horn will ask you questions concerning the results you hope to achieve with a tummy tuck. This will help Dr. Horn understand your desired results and determine if tummy tuck surgery is the right option for you. Your skin tone will be examined, and the amount of loose skin you now have will be assessed in addition to any surplus fat and the shape your abdominal muscles are in. You will be asked about the state of your health, pregnancies you’ve had, drug allergies, surgeries you’ve had and any medications you may be taking. We want to make sure you will benefit from this procedure and are in the appropriate medical condition to ensure you are at a reduced risk for complications. Your health and safety is our first priority, and we won’t perform a tummy tuck in Chicago until we are sure you will see the results you want without putting your overall health and wellbeing at risk.

#### THE TUMMY TUCK PROCEDURE
In just a couple of hours, while you are under general anesthesia, Dr. Horn will make a horizontal incision above your pubic area in order to begin the tummy tuck procedure. The length of the incision will depend upon the amount of skin that is there. The shape of the incision for the tummy tuck will be discussed beforehand, as it may be possible to keep the incision line of your tummy tuck within your bathing suit lines. Dr. Horn will discuss these decisions with you in detail prior to surgery.
