#### How Long Does It Take Breast Implants To Drop?

{{< youtube ZGkNcTV1ta4 >}}
Most implants drop within the first couple of months following surgery, but they continue looking more natural for about a year. The bigger your breast implants are, the more full on the top they’ll appear. We recommend patients massage downwards on the implant a few times a day in order to help it gradually “drop and fluff”.

#### Can Botox Be Preventative?

{{< youtube NrgmBc2LPL8 >}}
Yes, it can. Consistent Botox injections reduce the likelihood that you’ll develop more wrinkles in the future. It’s better to start Botox treatment early, so wrinkles never get a chance to fully form.

#### What’s The Difference Between Silicone and Saline Implants?

{{< youtube 8uedEilxvP8 >}}
Most people prefer silicone gel implants. These implants look, sit, and feel more natural. Saline implants are full of sterile saltwater. They often don’t mimic the shape of the breast as well and tend to look and feel less realistic. These implants are easier to see, and if you’re thin, you may be able to see the ripples of the bag or the edge of the implant. Many patients who used to have saline implants have since switched to gel.

#### How Long Do Breast Implants Last?

{{< youtube 4Wqs4sol8I0 >}}
Most implants, whether they’re silicone or saline, can last a very long time. For the first 10 years, implants typically remain in good condition. Once any type of implant is around 10 years old, monitor their condition with MRIs every three years or consider replacing them all together. With silicone implants, as soon as there’s a hole, they’ll need to be replaced.

In most cases, women can still breastfeed with breast implants without any issue. However, due to the way the body changes during pregnancy, the look of your implants may change after pregnancy regardless.

#### Does Breast Reduction Affect Breastfeeding?

{{< youtube obl_GAGj9lk >}}
While most patients are still able to breastfeed after a breast reduction, some patients are no longer able to. Although this outcome is unlikely, take this possibility into serious consideration before moving forward with the surgery.
