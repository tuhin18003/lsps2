#### What is HCG?
HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) is a hormone naturally produced in large quantity during pregnancy is used in infertility treatment for both men and women. ATW Simeons found that small regular doses of HCG caused the body to release abnormal fat when used in conjunction with a specific 500 calorie daily diet. This is detailed in Dr. Simeons Manuscript: Pounds and Inches: A New Approach to Obesity. This low-calorie diet is only comfortable and advisable with HCG. Most participants are not hungry and have plenty of energy. The HCG protocol is safe for men and even works faster for men. While women typically lose .5 lb. – 1lb. per day, men typically lose .75 lb. – 1.5 lbs. per day. Again, HCG is prescribed for men with certain medical conditions, so this is not the only use of HCG with men.

#### How exactly does HCG allow you to lose weight?
The HCG allows your body to tap into your body’s abnormal fat deposits (shoulders, upper arms, hips, thighs, and buttocks). In obese clients, these deposits are not usually accessible to the body for fat consumption. The HCG present in the body allows these abnormal fat deposits to be tapped, releasing the abnormal fat into the blood stream and out of the body. This release of fat is also why clients taking the HCG are not hungry. The HCG releases 1500-4000 calories per day into the bloodstream. This is the ONLY reason why it is okay to be on a 500-calorie diet. Without the HCG releasing the abnormal fat and, therefore, thousands of calories into the bloodstream, the client would be starving and be facing excess nutritional deficiency.

#### Why the 500-calorie diet?
You are on a VLCD (very low-calorie diet) phase of the HCG diet. You are allowed only 500 calories because while you are on the HCG hormone, your body is releasing 1500-4000 calories from abnormal fat into your bloodstream each day. So, with the 500 calories you are consuming plus the 1500-4000 calories being released into your system, you are actually getting the benefit of (500 + 1500-4000) = 2000-4500 calories each day. Of course being on a 500 calorie diet will help you to lose weight.

#### How is the HCG protocol different from any other diet out there?
When an obese patient tries to reduce by starving himself, he will first lose his normal fat reserves. When these are exhausted, he begins to burn up structural fat, and only as a last resort will the body yield its abnormal reserves, though by that time the patient usually feels so weak and hungry that the diet is abandoned. It is just for this reason that obese patients complain that when they diet they lose the wrong fat. They feel famished and tired and their face becomes drawn and haggard, but their belly, hips, thighs, and upper arms show little improvement. The fat they have come to detest stays on and the fat they need to cover their bones gets less and less. Their skin wrinkles and they look old and miserable. And that is one of the most frustrating and depressing experiences a human being can have.
