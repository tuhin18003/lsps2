#### How Does Profractional Laser Therapy Work?

During your procedure we will use a tiny laser beam that will create thousands of microscopic channels into the skin. These channels will stimulate the regeneration of collagen, sparking a natural healing response in the body. Only a small fraction of the skin is treated, leaving the surrounding skin healthy to allow rapid healing and collagen remodeling. Profractional Therapy sessions take 15-30 minutes and are often scheduled in conjunction with Sciton BBL and Micro Laser Peel treatments. Optimal results are typically seen in 1-4 treatment sessions scheduled 3-6 weeks apart.

#### What Can Profractional Therapy Treat?

Profractional therapy can be used on just about any part of the body. However, most people have the procedure done on the chest, neck, hands, or face. We can adjust the settings of the laser based on the area treated. Profractional laser treatments can be used to treat acne scars, sun spots, loose skin, wrinkles, changes in pigmentation, and enlarged pores.

#### Who is a Good Candidate for Profractional Therapy?

Individuals who have discolored spots, wrinkles, acne scars or other skin conditions may be good candidates for this procedure. The treatment works well for all skin types, regardless of age or fairness of skin. Good candidates for Profrational treatment should have realistic expectations about the results of the procedure. After just one treatment, most patients will see noticeable results. However, after multiple sessions, you can see amazing results for deep scars, and other severe skin conditions. Individuals who suffer from cold sores or have other open sores or who have used Accutane at some time in the past year may not be eligible for treatment at the present time.

#### What is Recovery Like?

After the procedure, patients can expect about two days of mild swelling and redness. For about a week, there may be mild peeling of the skin much like a sunburn. Recovery time depends on the extent of the condition treated and will be different for each patient. Combination treatments, such as those in conjunction with Sciton BBL or Micro Laser Peel will likely require a slightly longer recovery time. Upon completion of the procedure, we will provide you with an ointment that will help soothe any discomfort you experience. We also recommend cold compresses to help reduce swelling and redness. Avoid using makeup or sunblock for three days or until it no longer causes discomfort when applying. After this phase of healing, we recommend you apply sunscreen often to the treated area for a few months in order to ensure the best results and to protect your skin.

#### Does Profractional Therapy Hurt?
Profractional laser therapy is generally considered to be a comfortable procedure. A topical cream is applied before treatment to numb the area and to ease any discomfort. Many patients report feeling a prickly tingling sensation that subsides once the treatment is completed. There may also be a sensation of heat to the area and a feeling similar to a sunburn.

#### How does Profractional Therapy Compare to Fractional CO2 Lasers?

Unlike Profactional laser treatment, fractional CO2 treatment removes an entire layer of skin on the face during the course of a treatment, which is more painful and requires a much longer healing time. Profractional laser therapy heals more quickly because small areas are targeted to promote collagen regeneration in the surrounding area, which requires less healing time. CO2 lasers can only be used on the face and in some cases causes a noticeable difference in pigmentation of the facial skin compared to the rest of the body. Sciton Profactional lasers can be used everywhere on the body to treat conditions that extend beyond the face, leaving the skin without any noticeable lines or changes in skin shade. Sciton Profractional Therapy is an impressive advancement in laser skin treatment, providing patients with younger, more vibrant, and healthier looking skin. Treatment is fast and comfortable, with rapid healing for results that can be seen in a matter of days.
