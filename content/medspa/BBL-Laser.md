#### Sciton BBL

(EFFECTIVE | NO DOWNTIME | VISIBLE RESULTS | PAIN FREE)

The Sciton BBL BroadBand Light is the world’s most powerful IPL device on the market. It is used for a vast array of skin conditions associated with aging, sun damage, and active life styles. Our Chicago practitioners administer the intense pulsed light to the skin’s outer layer, promoting collagen regeneration and changing the molecular structure of the skin cells. In doing so, we are able to minimize the appearance of fine lines, reduce pigmentation, improve acne scars, and permanently remove unwanted hair.

#### How Does Sciton BBL Work?

Sciton BBL treatment is often referred to as a photofacial or photorejuvination. The BBL’s advanced dual-lamp technology provides Intense Pulsed Light or IPL to the upper layers of the skin to promote collagen regeneration. A Stanford University study has proven that BBL treatments change the structure of the genes associated with aging and alter cells at a molecular level to rejuvenate skin for a more vibrant and youthful appearance. BBL’s adjustable Smart Filters allow for instant changes between wavelengths to treat a broad variety of conditions during a single session. The Sciton BBL’s precision thermoelectric cooling system utilizes sapphire crystals to automatically adjust cooling of the lamps to ensure a precise level of light is provided, allowing for the most effective treatment for each individual. Treatment can be performed on almost all parts of the body, but is most commonly used on the face, neck, chest, and hands. You can expect your Sciton BBL photofacials in Chicago to take between 15 and 30 minutes. After one treatment you will find your skin is clearer, tighter, and smoother, which may be enough to produce the results you want. However, the number of photofacials we recommend will vary based on your specific condition and what you expect. For most patients, three to six treatments spaced about two to four weeks apart are needed. We can also perform the Sciton BBL with other treatments as well, such as the Sciton Profractional Therapy and Sciton Micro Laser Peel to produce even greater results. When you consult with our Chicago office, we will go over the potential treatment options and help you make the right decision.

#### Who is a Good Candidate for Sciton BBL?

A good candidate for treatment with Sciton Broadband Light is a patient who is looking for a comfortable, fast-acting treatment for skin conditions caused by age, sun damage, and those wanting permanent laser hair removal. Individuals with busy lives who do not have time for treatments that require extended recovery time are especially good candidates, as Sciton BBL is a non-invasive technology that requires minimal downtime and does not require the skin to be ablated or vaporized to achieve desired results. Patients who are taking medications that cause sensitivity to light and patients who have used Accutane in the past six months may not be immediate candidates for BBL treatment. Patients with a dark skin tone or tan skin from sun exposure or tanning beds may not be good candidates for BBL treatment as melanin absorbs light and in some cases may cause hyperpigmentation. Patients with dark skin from tanning may be advised to wait up to a month without tanning before treatment. Schedule a consultation today to find out if you are a good candidate for Sciton BBL, or if one of our other skin resurfacing treatments is the ideal solution to obtain the skin of your dreams.

#### Do Laser Treatments Hurt with Sciton BBL?

Sciton BBL is the least painful laser treatment in the industry. Patients have likened the treatment to having a rubber band lightly snapped on the skin. The BBL’s safe and precise thermoelectric technology cools the laser to keep heat at a comfortable level throughout the treatment, and the adjustable filters allow large areas of skin to be treated with each flash of light making treatment as fast and pain-free as possible. A numbing cream may be applied to the area about 30 minutes before treatment to make the procedure more comfortable.

#### What is Recovery Like?

Sciton BBL requires minimal downtime as it is non-invasive and does not require ablation (vaporization) of the outer layer of skin. After the procedure, the skin will temporarily appear darker and may look mildly red or flushed. Most redness fades in just a few hours, and any remaining pinkness will fade over the next 7-10 days. Patients with darker pigmentation may notice mild flaking or peeling 1-2 weeks after treatment. A recommended cream or lotion may be applied to the skin immediately after treatment to promote healing, and makeup can be applied immediately after treatment to cover any remaining redness. Most patients resume normal daily activities immediately after treatment. Over the next few weeks, the skin will become smoother and wrinkles and other fine lines will be less noticeable. Sunscreen is recommended daily to protect skin and promote the best results possible. With Sciton’s cutting-edge skin resurfacing technology, our dedicated Chicago staff at The Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic Surgery will help restore your skin to its most vibrant, youthful, and rejuvenated state.
