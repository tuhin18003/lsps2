shortDescription : "Laser hair removal sends a laser light beam directly into the hair follicles. The energy from these lasers kills the root, but doesn’t injure the surrounding skin. Patients who undergo laser hair removal in Chicago often need to make multiple appointments to eliminate all of the hair during the growth stages. Hair grows in stages, which means not all follicles will be at the same stage at the exact same time. Most patients see the results they want in six treatments or fewer. Some individuals may feel some tingling or mild discomfort, but in general, this process is quite gentle. Most patients can resume their daily activities right after their treatment. There’s no need to take any downtime."

Laser hair removal in Chicago may sound like the perfect solution, but it won’t work properly for everyone. Individuals should have darker hair than their skin tone in order to get optimal results. Those who have lighter hair or their skin is darker will generally not see the best results. This is why our Chicago staff will evaluate you first to determine if you are a good candidate for the treatment. We understand how important it is for you to look your best. However, we want to make sure we only attempt the procedure on individuals who will see the results they’re looking for.

#### Cutera CoolGlide® Laser

Waxing, electrolysis and other previously used hair removal procedures typically generated extreme discomfort. Waxing only produces temporary results, while electrolysis takes years to complete. This makes the amount of discomfort not worth it for most patients. The Cutera CoolGlide® system effectively removes unwanted hair without the negative effects most people associate with other hair removal techniques. Most people see regular shaving as a hassle and a waste of time, but feel it’s necessary. Instead of shaving, laser hair removal in Chicago can be the ideal alternative. Our professionals will safely and effectively remove hair from the desired area. Over time, the hair will fail to grow back, eliminating the need to shave in the future.
