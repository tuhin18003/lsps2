#### Non-invasive. Non-surgical. Highly-effective. 
As we age, our skin begins to show the effects of time — a feature not always welcome on our bodies or in the mirror. Understandably, we seek ways to minimize or eliminate the effects of aging on our skin as much as possible, particularly when we feel its appearance doesn’t match our persistent sense of youth and vitality.
<br><br>Meet the Morpheus8, a revolutionary new non-surgical skin tightening and contouring device designed to slow—and even reverse—the signs of aging through a unique combination of microneedling and radio frequency technology. Your skin has always been with you and deserves the best treatment to achieve your cosmetic goals and return it to a youthful tone, texture, and appearance. As aesthetics technology continues to increase our capabilities and impress patients with striking results, we are making it possible to look younger for longer without any need for surgery or invasive techniques. 
<br><br>By targeting the skin’s building blocks below the surface, Morpheus8 achieves effective and lasting rejuvenation that results in tighter, more radiant, and more youthful skin without the use of surgery, injections, or foreign chemicals. Because of its non-invasive and innovative nature, Morpheus8 is considered one of the safest and most effective skin tightening technologies available today, and the best part — it can be used virtually anywhere on the body. 
<br><br>

#### What is Morpheus8?
Morpheus8 is the latest advancement in non-invasive skin tightening technology and is the first-ever device to combine both microneedling and radio frequency — achieving remarkable skin firming and tightening results. By targeting the skin’s building blocks and adipose fat tissue below the surface, Morpheus8 penetrates beneath the skin and stimulates remodeling, tightening, and contouring at the very foundation. This type of non-surgical treatment is perfect for various areas on the body, particularly in locations where fat is difficult to remove and affects appearance such as in the case of sagging neck skin, facial jowls, and stretch marks around the breasts, buttocks, and more. 
<br><br>
On the surface, the Morpheus8’s microneedling feature targets the skin’s superficial dermis and stimulates the production of collagen, elastin, and brand-new skin cells. Used together, these two advanced technologies offer remarkable cosmetic improvement and are what make Morpheus8 the world’s leading treatment in non-surgical and effective skin rejuvenation. Because it can be used anywhere on the body, Morpheus8 is ideal for the treatment of sagging skin, wrinkles, fine lines, stretch marks, scarring, contour imperfections and more with a focus on tightening, remodeling, and beautifying the skin through safe and non-invasive techniques. 
<br><br>
Morpheus8 is perfect for aging skin, but also works wonders for younger patients seeking to make cosmetic improvements on the face and other features of their body. Because it is non-surgical and non-invasive, treatment with Morpheus8 requires very little downtime and can be performed even with a busy schedule, work, and school.

#### What are Microneedling and Radio Frequency (RF)? 
Microneedling is a cosmetic technology designed to promote collagen, elastin, and skin cell production on the surface of the skin. By creating micropunctures on the superficial dermis, Morpheus8 stimulates natural healing processes that bring back tone, texture, and radiance to your skin features as well as reduce or eliminate undesirable imperfections. Microneedling is the perfect solution for a wide variety of skin conditions such as wrinkles, scarring, large pores, stretch marks, rough texture, saggy skin, and inconsistent pigmentation. Microneedling is performed with a topical anesthetic to prevent sensation during the procedure. 
<br><br>
Radio frequency skin tightening is a technology used to deliver focused energy below the skin’s surface and directly to the adipose fatty tissue where the building blocks of skin are naturally developed. When radio frequency energy is focused, it generates heat and has unique effects on the adipose tissue which it targets. RF skin tightening promotes collagen and elastin production at the foundation of the skin below its surface, which results in cosmetic benefits on the surface and structural benefits within the skin itself. 
<br><br>
RF skin tightening also triggers a natural process called fibroplasia, which causes new fibrous tissue to be formed and shortens collagen fibers, making the skin tighter and promoting firmness and elasticity. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

>
#### What Makes Morpheus8 Better than Other Microneedling Treatments? 
Powered by the latest and most advanced microneedling technology available, Morpheus8 can deliver precise micropuncture penetration up to 4 millimeters deep — deeper than any microneedling technology to date. For patients, this signifies far greater skin tightening and repair potential with access to stubborn skin areas, textures, and conditions that may otherwise withstand treatment from standard microneedling devices. As an FDA approval Subdermal Adipose Remodeling Device (SARD), Morpheus8’s state-of-the-art entry into cosmetic technology achieves previously unseen adipose modeling results without the use of surgery, injections, or other invasive treatments.

<p>&nbsp;</p>


>
#### Is Microneedling with RF Painful? 
As non-invasive and non-surgical skin tightening treatments, microneedling and RF are uniquely designed to produce optimal results with virtually no pain or discomfort. Through the help of a topical anesthetic, patients will experience a desensitized, numbing sensation in the target area where the treatment is being performed. During the procedure, you may feel a mild and temporary sensation as the microneedling and RF devices pass over your skin, but this should cause no discomfort or pain.
<br><br>
After the procedure, patients may experience mild swelling and soreness at the treatment area and will be provided with over-the-counter pain relief medication to assist them during the short recovery period.

#### Who is a Candidate for Morpheus8? 
Morpheus8 is designed for all skin types and serves to benefit anyone seeking cosmetic skin resurfacing and tightening while helping avoid risks commonly associated with surgery, injectables, and other aggressive skin treatments. Almost any adult is a candidate for Morpheus8, which is ideal for every type of skin tone and comes with very little risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, a condition that is known to occur with other skin tightening treatments when applied to darker skin tones. To ensure your safety and best results, a thorough analysis of any skin or medical conditions will be conducted during your visit prior to receiving treatment.
<br><br>
Morpheus8 is the ideal solution for a wide variety of skin conditions that include: 
<ul>
<li>Jowls, or mild sagging around the face and neck</li>
<li>Nasolabial folds, or smile lines</li>
<li>Fine lines and skin creases</li>
<li>Wrinkles</li>
<li>Stretch marks</li>
<li>Acne & acne scars</li>
<li>Rough skin texture</li>
<li>Enlarged pores</li>
<li>Sun-damaged skin, or photoaging</li>
<li>Stubborn fatty deposits associated with aging</li>
</ul>
Many patients that benefit from Morpheus8 have cosmetic goals that don’t necessarily qualify for facelift surgery and are seeking the most powerful non-invasive skin tightening technology available. It’s the ideal treatment for anyone who would like to take a conservative approach to skin remodeling while enjoying the best that modern technology has to offer. It is also an exceptional tool for facelift maintenance in the case of patients that have received facelift surgery and are seeking to preserve the results through continual care. When used by qualified professionals under strict quality standards and conditions, Morpheus8 has shown a very high safety and success rate with all skin types and tones.

#### Is There a Recovery Time and Side-Effects to Morpheus8? 
After the procedure, patients may experience some redness or swelling as the regenerative effects of microneedling and high frequency treatment settle and the skin completes the recovery process. Some patients have been known to experience mild temporary bruising and slight skin flaking post-treatment. Since microneedling involves micro punctures of the skin, the recovery process may involve tiny bits of crusting that will fall off or can be washed away. 
<br><br>
Mild soreness and tender skin is a normal side-effect of skin tightening treatment and can be controlled with over-the-counter pain relief medication in the days following the procedure. You will have a review of all expected and possible side-effects during your visit to determine your treatment plan and avoid any complications. The recovery period of Morpheus8 treatment should take no longer than several days, however, patients should practice post-treatment care for several weeks following the procedure to ensure safe and lasting results.   

<p>&nbsp;</p>

>
#### What Should I Expect after the Treatment?
DIt is common to experience mild skin sensitivity and dryness for several weeks after treatment. During this time period, patients are advised to apply sunscreen while outdoors to prevent UV damage to their healing skin. Temporary skin dryness can be treated with moisturizer during the recovery process. Your aesthetician will recommend products that will aid in hydration and recovery. 
<br><br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

>
#### How Many Treatments Will I Need to See Results? 
The amount of treatments necessary to achieve desired results depends on the condition being treated and the recommended course of action based on an analysis of your skin and best expectations. Many patients are able to achieve results with just a single treatment, while others may seek more extensive results that will require several treatments to achieve. During your consultation, we will make an assessment of your skin texture, tone, firmness and other conditions before making a recommended course of treatment for optimal results. 
<br><br>
In the case of stubborn target areas and advanced skin conditions, up to 3 or 4 treatments may be recommended. When treatment involves more than one procedure, these will take place 3-6 weeks apart to allow for complete tissue recovery in between sessions. 
<br><br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

>
#### How Quickly Will I See Results? 
Patients can expect to see noticeable results just several days after treatment, during which time any swelling, redness, or tenderness should subside. Your skin will then continue to improve in tone, texture, and radiance over the course of several weeks up to 3 months as the effects of new collagen and elastin production in your skin take shape. 
<br><br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

>
#### How Long Before I Can Wear Makeup Again? 
After the procedure, you may be advised to avoid wearing makeup for 1-2 days to prevent irritating your newly-treated skin, which will typically have mild swelling or redness at and around the target area depending on the amount of treatment you have received. You may begin applying makeup again after this time period or as recommended.
