#### How does Micro Laser Peel Work?

During a Micro Laser Peel treatment, the outer layer of the skin is ablated using Sciton’s Refined Erbium laser technology to micro-resurface the skin and remove damaged and dead skin cells, exposing a healthy & vibrant layer of skin to the surface. Depth of treatment can be precisely adjusted based on patient’s wrinkle severity and specific skin condition. The laser can also be adjusted for lighter treatments that are similar to a superficial acid peel, or for deeper treatments to provide a full resurfacing of the skin.

Sciton’s Signature Micro Laser Peel resurfaces the skin, removing damage from UV rays and promoting collagen regeneration to give the skin a tighter, smoother appearance. The Micro Laser Peel is often referred to as a “weekend peel,” as treatments involve a short healing process and minimal downtime, while providing noticeable results in just a matter of days. A numbing cream is typically applied to the treatment area before to reduce any discomfort. The procedure generally takes less than one hour and results are evident in a matter of days. After the first treatment, results will be most noticeable for the first 6-12 months. Longer lasting results can be obtained with 3-5 treatments spaced 3-6 weeks apart. After treatment, patients are given a healing balm to protect and soothe the skin as it recovers.

#### What Can be Treated With Sciton Micro Laser Peel?

A Micro Laser Peel is the perfect solution for patients who want to remove sunspots, age spots, blemishes, and other skin changes caused by sun exposure, aging or scarring. It is also an excellent treatment to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines around the eyes, mouth and forehead. Micro Laser Peels can reduce the appearance of acne and other superficial scars on the surface of the skin, as well as reduce the appearance of pores. This treatment is most commonly performed on the face, neck, and chest and pairs beautifully with BBL treatments. Micro Laser Peel is effective on all skin types, regardless of age or fairness of skin.

#### Micro Laser Peel Recovery

After Micro Laser Peel treatment, the skin will be pink, mildly swollen and slightly tender – similar to a sunburn. The skin typically heals in 3-4 days with a dramatic reduction of redness by the third day. A recommended healing balm may be used during the first few days of recovery to ease any discomfort. Makeup can be applied to cover any remaining redness after 3-7 days. Most patients return to work in just 2-3 days, and treatment can be scheduled at the end of the week to allow the majority of healing to occur over the weekend. Sunscreen is recommended for the first few months to protect the skin. The improvement in skin texture and tightness will be most noticeable after 2-4 weeks and optimal results can be achieved after 3-5 treatments spaced 3-6 weeks apart.

#### Does Micro Laser Peel Treatment Hurt?

Micro Laser Peel is generally considered to be a comfortable procedure that causes minimal discomfort. A topical ointment is applied to the skin about 30 minutes before treatment to numb the area and ease any discomfort. During treatment, there will be a sensation similar to a sunburn that will last for about an hour, then will fade significantly to a mild discomfort resembling a mild sunburn as it heals.

#### How Does Micro Laser Peel Compare to Similar Treatments?

Micro Laser Peel is a more advanced, modern technology compared to similar treatments such as microdermabrasion and chemical peels. During microdermabrasion, tiny crystals are sprayed onto the face and are then “sanded” off using a special instrument to remove the outer layer of skin. Microdermabrasion only reaches a deepness of 10-15 microns into the skin and is not as effective at reducing wrinkles and acne scars. Sciton’s Micro Laser Peel can be precisely adjusted to 10-50 microns depending on the desired results for each patient and can accomplish a full epidermal peel. During a chemical peel, an acid is applied to the face for a specific period of time before being neutralized. Superficial peels are generally performed using glycolic acid. Deeper peels require a harsher acid such as trichloretic acid or phenol, which cause a second-degree burn that kills the outer layer of skin, bringing a new layer of the skin to the surface. Superficial peels generally heal in a few days and require little downtime, while deep peels can take 3 weeks to 2 months to heal may require a sedative to ease discomfort. Chemical peels are applied to the entire face and can not be used to target specific problem areas as can be accomplished with Micro Laser Peel.
