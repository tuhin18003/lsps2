This injection has been proven to provide relief from wrinkles, crow’s feet, forehead creases and thick bands in the neck.

#### How Does It Work

When you choose Botox in Chicago, we will determine your problem areas, and where the injections should be placed for the effect, you are looking for. Once the locations are set, we will inject the Botox solution underneath the skin. This solution causes the muscles to contract, filling out your skin to eliminate the look of wrinkles and other signs of aging. One of the side effects you may experience is numbness and loss of muscle function, but these effects are temporary. Unfortunately, Botox treatment is also temporary, which means you will have to obtain new injections every few months. However, if you are happy with the results, getting new injections is harmless and the ideal option to keep your face looking younger. We will discuss the pros and cons of this procedure with you before we start. This will include letting you know how long you should expect it to last and help you determine if it is the right solution for your needs.

#### Who Can Benefit

The Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic Surgery performs Botox in Chicago. While this procedure is designed to reverse the effects of aging on your skin, there is no set age at which wrinkles and other signs of aging may appear. This means we sometimes treat patients in their early 20s, just like we can treat patients in their 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond. In fact, we see patients of all ages. In many cases, it’s younger patients who are concerned with looking older than they actually are. Botox can help eliminate these signs of aging and help patients of all ages look and feel their best. Anyone who wants to get rid of their wrinkles is encouraged to make an appointment at our Chicago office to go over the options and determine if this treatment is the right option.

Many people hesitate to move forward with Botox in Chicago because they don’t know how it works. Getting Botox injections is a fast, effective way of smoothing out the wrinkles. We can perform most procedures in less than 30 minutes, allowing you to move on with your daily life. While you may experience minor discomfort or minor side effects, the treatment is relatively safe and can provide the amazing results you are looking for. When you leave our office, you will look great and enjoy a younger-looking face. You won’t have to worry about how to hide the scars or whether you will have a natural look when you are done. You can go back to work or continue to go about your daily business immediately following your treatment.

#### What are the results of Botox® Injections?

Results are normally seen within a few days but full results were seen at two weeks. Aesthetic results last 3-4 months and treatments for excessive sweating can last up to a year. While Botox in Chicago is designed to eliminate wrinkles and other signs of aging, there are other effects we have found to be beneficial for those who choose this treatment method. For instance, Botox has been found to reduce migraines in those who receive treatments. The solution can also resolve excessive sweating issues and muscle spasms in the neck and eyes.

It’s important to schedule a consultation at our Chicago office before undergoing Botox treatments. At this consultation, our team of professionals will sit down with you and discuss the specifics of the procedure and what you can expect, both during and afterward. This will ensure you are fully prepared and can make an informed decision whether you want to proceed with the treatment. Once you are ready, we will schedule your appointment for Botox injections, giving you the chance to restore your youthful appearance.
