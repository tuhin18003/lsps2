#### What is the Venus Legacy?

This procedure is an innovative method of reducing cellulite, toning the body, and erasing wrinkles. It uses radio frequencies and pulsed magnetic fields in order to heat up the collagen and tissues. This heat stimulates the production of collagen and increases blood flow to the treated area. The Venus Legacy procedure is safe, quick, and painless, giving you the best results without having to undergo surgery. We can treat your entire face and body in as little as an hour with no downtime. In fact, our Chicago patients can resume their normal activity immediately after their procedure.

#### What Parts of the Body Can Be Treated With the Venus LegacyMethod?

Venus Legacy can be used on all parts of the body. However, the areas of the body that get the best results include the abdomen, thighs, neck, face, arms, and buttocks. This treatment is effective at removing cellulite by tightening the skin and creating a firmer, more youthful appearance to the thighs, legs, buttocks, and other areas affected by cellulite. In addition to eliminating cellulite, it is also an anti-aging treatment to reduce wrinkles around the forehead, mouth, eyes and other parts of the face and body. Venus Legacycan be an excellent option for new mothers. New mothers often struggle to restore their body to the way it was before pregnancy. Diet and exercise can often help, but sometimes it’s not enough to firm the skin that became loose during pregnancy. Because this treatment tightens the skin and can reduce stretch marks, it is an excellent postpartum solution.

#### About Venus Legacy Treatments

The Venus Legacy treatment is performed while the patient is lying down on one of our comfortable treatment beds in Chicago. We apply a glycerin gel to the skin and then gently slide the applicator across the skin’s surface. Many patients report this procedure feels similar to receiving a massage with the use of a warming gel. The treatment process is gentle, fast and pain-free and is often completed in an hour. After the procedure is complete, you will feel a warm sensation, not cold as the name would imply. Your skin may appear pink for a short period of time but should return to normal within an hour. When you leave our Chicago office, you will feel relaxed and shouldn’t feel any pain or discomfort.

#### The Results

Once the Venus Legacy treatment is complete you should notice softened wrinkles, tighter skin, reduced cellulite, and improved body contours. However, these results may require three treatments to be fully noticeable. Most patients require six to 10 treatments to achieve the optimal results with appointments scheduled approximately a week apart. You can maintain your results by undergoing a Venus Legacy four times per year. Some patients prefer monthly sessions for the best results.
