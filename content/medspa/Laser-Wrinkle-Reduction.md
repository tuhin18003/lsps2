#### How Does It Work?

The treatment reveals a refreshed skin tone and brighter, healthier complexion. The laser gently vaporizes superficial skin layers and boosts collagen production as new cells grow to replace the old, damaged layers. Laser wrinkle treatment uses short pulses of fine laser light to get deep into the skin and treat the support structure as it ages. Afterwards, the bodyâ€™s natural healing process eliminates older, damaged skin tissues and restores it with new elastin and collagen. The quick procedure may cause temporary discomfort and redness, but most patients are able to return to normal activities immediately after treatment with no downtime. Some patients may require multiple treatments to achieve optimum results.

At The Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic Surgery, we can help you enhance or maintain your beautiful skin, helping to refresh and rejuvenate your skin. Dr. Horn and his staff help his patients achieve their appearance goals by combining experience, talent, and the highest quality medical care.
