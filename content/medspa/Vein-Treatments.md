#### Laser Vein Treatment for the Face and Body

At his Chicago practice, Dr. Horn utilizes advanced vein treatments to help reduce the appearance of spider veins and help his patients enjoy a healthy, youthful look. Although both men and women develop spider veins, men do not typically seek treatment because the veins are concealed by leg hair. Many women, however, are self-conscious about their spider veins, which may be blue, red, or purple in color and can branch out in multiple directions. The veins, which occur for a number of reasons, may cause burning, itching, cramping, or other bothersome side effects. Fortunately, Dr. Horn can help patients at his Chicago practice with safe, effective vein treatments.

#### What Causes Spider Veins

Varicose vein and spider veins are usually found in the legs and are often caused by malfunctioning valves in the greater saphenous vein (GSV). When these valves aren’t working properly, they create a backflow of blood that then leaks into the legs and feet. The pressure from this excess blood causes veins to bulge and become darker in color, making them stand out from other veins and the rest of the skin.

#### How It Works

The vein treatment is a quick outpatient procedure to reduce the appearance of spider veins. This laser delivers pulses of light energy to cause the blood within the vein to coagulates and eventually destroy the vessel which is then absorbed back into your body. The blood flood is redirected to veins deeper below the skin’s surface so that the problem should not reoccur. This is a fast treatment and you will begin to see result immediately.
