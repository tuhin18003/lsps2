#### How Skinpen Works

**At our Chicago, Illinois center, we understand that breast enlargement surgery is a personal decision and that individual goals vary.**

After a consultation for skinpen treatment at the Michael Horn Center for Cosmetic Surgery, one of our experienced skinpen technicians will personally perform the procedure. A numbing cream is applied to prevent any discomfort during the treatment. Thus, the procedure is essentially pain free. The unique skinpen tip utilizes a spring-loaded device to create automated stamp like motions that will be guided over your skin. It utilizes microneedles that are easily customizable for different treatment areas. Our technicians are well educated on how to treat different scarring and wrinkles with these customizable needles. They will tailor the micro needle precisions to exactly what your scarring or wrinkles need to be rejuvenated. The process preserves the protective barrier of the skin and activates the normal production of collagen-the most popular protein in your body and a major building block for skin. It’s delivery system is sophisticated, enhancing results while providing a safer method of treatment in comparison to other micro-needling devices.

#### Aftercare

There is minimal downtime after this simple aesthetic procedure. However, there are some guidelines you are recommended to follow in order to achieve your best results. After undergoing the micro needling procedure, you should not expose yourself to the sun, apply any “active” skin products, use collagen stimulating peptides, and avoid the use of makeup for around 24 hours after your treatment.
