#### What Is UltraShape Power?

{{< youtube xJ_A8ChzKrs >}}

UltraShape™ Power is an FDA-approved non-invasive body-shaping procedure that helps to reduce fat cells in the body. It targets the fat that is resistant to diet and exercise. Ares include abdomen, flanks, inner and outer thighs. UltraShape™ Power is a painless procedure that shows no unwanted signs of treatment and doesn’t require any recovery time.

#### How Does It Work?

{{< youtube LXjycDLiBGc >}}

UltraShape™ Power works by emitting acoustic waves of ultrasonic energy that converge into a confined focal volume targeting only subcutaneous fat at a controlled depth. Unlike traditional ultrasound technology, UltraShape™ Power energy transmits pulsed ultrasound, allowing control over temperature elevation (less than 0.5° C increase) and enabling fat destruction to occur instantly, selectively and mechanically (non-thermal).

#### What to Expect During The Procedure


The non-invasive UltraShape™ Power procedure is pleasant and relaxing. A trained technician will apply gel to the targeted area then move the UltraShape™ Power transducer device along the treatment area, releasing ultrasound pulses. This treatment typically lasts an hour or less.

#### Two Types Of Fat

Your body houses two different types of fat – visceral and subcutaneous. Visceral fat is the fat the forms around your organs and can be eliminated by eating healthy and exercising regularly. Subcutaneous fat, on the other hand, forms under the surface of your skin and can be very difficult to lose. UltraShape™ Power targets this subcutaneous fat that is resistant to diet and exercise.

#### The Ideal UltraShape™Power Candidate

The UltraShape™Power procedure is not designed for major weight loss. It is most effective for those that eat healthy and exercise regularly, but still have a little stubborn fat that they can’t get rid of. The ideal candidate has a BMI of less than 30 and about an inch or so of fat around the area.

#### When Will I See Results?

Results will vary for each individual. Some patients reported that they saw results two weeks after their first treatment, but we believe you will see the best results after a minimum of three treatments, scheduled two weeks apart. This will give your body time to rid the fat cells from your system before the next treatment, allowing for maximum results.
