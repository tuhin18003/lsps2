#### What is a Forehead Lift (Brow Lift)?

Some patients find that the natural aging process, sun exposure, genetics, and other factors can cause deep forehead furrows that create a tired or unhappy appearance. Typically performed on patients over the age of 40, the forehead lift procedure can produce a soft, smooth, rejuvenated look for our Chicago cosmetic surgery clients. A forehead lift (also known as a brow lift) is similar to a [facelift](/face/facelift/), but works specifically to raise eyebrows, reduce wrinkle lines, target frown lines and reposition a low brow.

##### _How do I Know if I am a Good Candidate for a Forehead Lift?_

A brow lift may be the ideal cosmetic surgery option for you if you have deep creasing along the forehead, low or sagging eyebrows, or frown lines in between the eyebrows above the nose. With aging and the effects of gravity over time, the face will begin to sag. Genetics and environmental differences can affect the amount of sagging and how quickly it occurs, but it is possible for anybody to experience facial changes that cause embarrassment or self-consciousness.

#### The Brow Lift Procedure

First, anesthesia will be administered to prevent the patient from feeling any pain or discomfort during the forehead lift procedure. Incisions will be made along the scalp, and in some cases along the upper eyelids and the forehead. The skin and layers of tissue are then lifted up and reattached in the desired position. Dr. Horn will lift the brows, remove or modify the muscles that cause frown lines, and cut out excess sagging skin. The result is a face that appears more youthful and awake. Many patients say that after the procedure, they look like they have always had a great night’s sleep.

#### Preparing for a Brow Lift

If you are a smoker, you will need to quit at least two two weeks prior to the procedure and for a period afterward. Smoking can hinder your body’s ability to heal and cause serious complications. You will need to provide information about any medications you are taking and you may be required to stop using some before surgery such as aspirin and other blood thinners. Be sure to let your doctor know about all the medications you are taking, whether they are over the counter or prescription. Also tell your doctor about any vitamins and supplements you are taking. You will also need to arrange for somebody to drive you home after surgery and help you through the first days of healing.

#### Forehead Lift Recovery

After surgery you may experience minor pain, for which you will be prescribed a painkiller. Applying cold compresses gently to your face will greatly reduce swelling and bruising and help to relieve any discomfort. Keeping your head elevated while sleeping by propping yourself up with pillows will also help to reduce swelling. Avoid straining while bending or lifting to prevent injury to the incision sites. Avoid direct exposure to sunlight in the initial healing period by wearing a wide-brimmed hat.

We will remove your stitches five to ten days after the procedure. You may have some puffiness, skin discoloration, and unevenness for a few days after the bandages are removed. Swelling and bruising will reduce greatly over the first few days and should be almost completely gone in about two weeks. The benefits of your forehead lift will last indefinitely and revision surgery is rarely needed.
