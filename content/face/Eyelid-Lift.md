shortDescription : "Eyelid surgery, known as blepharoplasty, is an effective treatment for individuals who have excess skin in the eye area or who suffer from puffiness in the upper or lower eyelid. We provide eyelid lift treatments at our Chicago office for anyone who wishes to improve or change the look of their eyes.

Those as young as 30 years old may discover the skin around their eyes has begun to show more signs of age than other facial features. A great way to remedy this aging effect is with an eyelid lift. This procedure will reduce the appearance of loose skin and help create a more youthful and rested look.

Performed as an outpatient procedure with local or general anesthesia, some patients may experience side effects, but they are usually temporary. The most common side effects encountered after eyelid surgery include sensitivity to light, swelling, bruising, dry eyes, tight skin and discomfort. In most cases, our patients are able to return to their normal activities, including work, within a week or two of the procedure.

When you have eyelid surgery at our Chicago office, we are careful to make small incisions so your procedure is minimally invasive. As a result, there is little scarring and the results are natural. Dr. Michael Horn will take the time to discuss your goals for the procedure and make sure the treatment fits your needs so you are pleased with the results."

#### Deciding on an Eyelid Lift

An eyelid lift, also known as blepharoplasty, eliminates upper eyelid droop and removes fat from the eyelids. It can help individuals who have bags under the eyes as well as too much skin sagging down over them. Because the incision is made in the folds of the lid, scars are generally unnoticeable after surgery. An eyelid lift procedure results in eyes that look younger and more attractive.

#### Are you a Good Candidate for Blepharoplasty?

Patients who are best suited for this procedure are those with dark bags under the eyes,
excess skin on the upper eyelid (whether impairing vision or just unsightly), baggy or puffy eye skin, or eyes that always look tired.

Blepharoplasty can effectively change your appearance to make you look younger and more awake. It is a minor surgery compared to a facelift, but an eyelid lift can have a major impact on your overall appearance. After all, the eyes are a window to the soul and they are the most common focal point during conversation.

Take a look at our eyelid lift before and after pictures to see how this surgery has changed the faces of our other patients. If you are looking for a more drastic change in the appearance of your face, you may want to consider a facelift or other facial plastic surgery option in conjunction with your eyelid lift.

#### Combination Procedures
You may decide to have other procedures done while you are undergoing eyelid lift surgery. Facelifts and skin resurfacing can be performed along with the eyelid lift, giving a smooth and youthful appearance to the entire face. Another option during your eyelid lift is minor liposuction of the face. Let us know if there are any results you desire in addition to your eyelift and we will provide more details about combining blepharoplasty with other procedures.

#### Eyelid Lift Risks and Considerations
Like any surgery, an eyelid lift procedure does have some risks including infection, bleeding, and adverse reaction to anesthesia. It is normal for vision to be blurry for a few days after surgery and there may be a slight imbalance between the eyelids as they heal. Eyelids may be temporarily swollen after surgery.

#### Blepharoplasty Recovery
About a week after the procedure, we will remove your stitches in our office. Swelling is normal after surgery but most patients are back to their normal daily routine in about a week. After two weeks the majority of bruising and swelling will be gone.

For the first few nights after surgery, we advise sleeping in an elevated position to reduce swelling. This can be accomplished by adding a few extra pillow beneath your head and upper body. Applying cold packs to the eyes can greatly reduce bruising and swelling in the days following surgery. Physical activity should be reduced for two weeks after the procedure as swelling heals.
