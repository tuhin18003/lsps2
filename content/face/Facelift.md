The facelift procedure, also known as rhytidectomy, is a cosmetic surgery commonly performed on patients over age 40 to refine overall appearance and create a youthful, rested, attractive look. Rhytidectomy can be used to eliminate loose neck and face skin, crow’s feet, and fine forehead lines. It is also effective at eliminating a sagging, loose jowl and redefines the area between the chin and neck. This will create a younger looking, smoother face to eliminate the signs of aging. A Chicago facelift can give you the face you had ten years ago with just a few incisions.

#### RHYTIDECTOMY SURGERY

During the facelift procedure, small incisions are made on the temple at the hairline as well as in front and top of the ear. After these incisions are made the skin is lifted upwards, tightening the muscles and the tissues, and then repositioned with sutures at the desired location. During this process fat and excess skin will be removed from the face if necessary.

The entire facelift procedure takes only two to four hours to complete depending on the amount of work needed. To ensure you do not feel any pain or discomfort during the facelift procedure you will be sedated using local or IV anesthesia. Once the facelift surgery is completed, sterile dressings will be placed over the incisions to protect them from infection.

#### PREPARING FOR A FACELIFT

If you are a smoker you will be asked to stop at least two weeks prior to surgery and for a period afterward. Smoking can hinder your body’s ability to heal and cause serious complications. You will be asked about the medications you take including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements. You will need to arrange for a friend or family member to drive you home and help you during the first few days of recovery.

#### FACELIFT RECOVERY

After your cosmetic surgery has been completed, you may experience slight pain, which will usually subside in one or two days. You will be prescribed medication to help with any pain. Temporary bruising and swelling are normal in this stage of recovery. A cold compress applied gently to the face will help with pain and reduce swelling. The dressing on your face will be removed in 24 to 48 hours.

##### Recovery Tips:

* Keep your head elevated, especially at night while you sleep
* Avoid strenuous activity
* Have family and friends help you with daily tasks and errands
* Tell your doctor if you are experiencing serious discomfort

Your sutures will be removed in our office five to ten days after your procedure. If you are fitted with a drainage tube, it will be removed on the first or second day following the procedure. You will be ready to go back to work in two to three weeks, but remember to rest and not over-work yourself in the recovery period following your facelift surgery.

If you have any concerns about your facelift procedure, our experienced staff will be more than happy to answer your questions and explain the recovery process in detail.

#### FACELIFT SCARS AND SIDE EFFECTS

While there is always a chance of scarring after any surgery, your facelift scars are typically not going to be noticeable once they have matured. You can disguise them with makeup or by covering them with hair until they have faded. After a couple of weeks, as your skin and tissue heals and relaxes, the results of the surgery will take on a more natural effect.
