#### How Does It Work?
Once you make the decision to undergo rhinoplasty, you may wonder what the procedure will be like. When we perform the surgery, we use sedation or general anesthesia so you won’t experience any pain during the procedure. We then make several small incisions inside the nose, eliminating the possibility of visible scarring after the procedure is over. Unfortunately, there may be some situations where external incisions may be necessary to achieve the look you want, however, we do try to avoid this as often as possible. If you are reducing the size of your nose, we will remove bone and cartilage from the nose so you have a straight profile. If we must remove a bump, we will carefully file away cartilage until we achieve the shape you are looking for. We can also address any breathing issues during the surgery.

Our goal is to provide comprehensive nose altering procedures. We understand it is a big decision to have rhinoplasty surgery, which is why our doctor and his staff are here to answer any questions you may have before, during or after the procedure. We will also walk you step by step through what will happen while the treatment is performed. This is to provide you with peace of mind that you are getting the nose you want.
