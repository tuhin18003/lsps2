shortDescription : "Used to change the basic shape of the face and create a more proportioned look, facial implants can be placed along the jawline or used to enhance the cheekbones or chin. The implants come in a range of shapes and sizes and may be manufactured from a number of materials. Incisions for facial implants can usually be carefully hidden in facial contours, ensuring a natural result. Typically performed as an outpatient surgery with general anesthesia or local anesthesia with sedation, facial implants can be a highly effective option for many patients. Temporary side effects may include stiffness, numbness, and swelling, and most patients are able to return to light activities in one to two weeks.

For an improved facial contour, Dr. Horn may recommend facial implants to patients at his Chicago practice. An extremely effective facial plastic surgery option, the implants create a balanced and attractive look."
